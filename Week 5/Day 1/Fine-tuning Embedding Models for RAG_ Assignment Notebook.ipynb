Each anchor sentence in the batch is paired with one positive sentence and is used to compare against all other sentences in the batch as negatives.\n","    - It calculates similarity scores between the anchor and all other sentences, then applies a softmax function to these scores. The goal is to maximize the similarity between the anchor and the positive sentence while minimizing it with all other sentences (negatives).\n","    - The loss is computed using cross-entropy, which penalizes the model if the positive sentence's similarity score is not higher than that of the negative sentences.\n","\n","MatryoshkaLoss\n","- Purpose: MatryoshkaLoss extends the idea of using multiple loss functions at different embedding dimensions. It allows us to apply a base loss function (like MultipleNegativesRankingLoss) across a series of progressively smaller embedding dimensions. This is useful for when training a model where users have the option to lower the embedding dimension to improve their embedding comparison speed and costs.\n","\n","- How It Works:\n","    - The core idea is to train embeddings at different dimensions (e.g., 768, 512, 256, etc.), which can be useful for models that may need to operate at various dimensionalities depending on the deployment scenario.\n","    - It uses a specified base loss function and applies it at each of these dimensions. The loss values at each dimension are weighted according to specified weights and summed to get the final loss. In the code, we didn't input the weights, so the weights are set to 1 for all dimension\n","    - The loss function allows us to use smaller dimensions to speed up inference and reduce costs while
