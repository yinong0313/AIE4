Gathering such data can be challenging.\n","- Contextual Nuance: It might not capture the nuances of how different contexts affect query-document relationships.\n","\n","For training Q&A:\n","- Relevance: Ensure that the related pairs are truly similar or related to avoid training the model on misleading or noisy data.\n","- Variety: Use a diverse set of related pairs to help the model

Each anchor sentence in the batch is paired with one positive sentence and is used to compare against all other sentences in the batch as negatives.\n","    - It calculates similarity scores between the anchor and all other sentences, then applies a softmax function to these scores. The goal is to maximize the similarity between the anchor and the positive sentence while minimizing it with all other sentences (negatives).\n","    - The loss is computed using cross-entropy, which penalizes the model if the positive sentence's similarity score is not higher than that of the negative sentences.\n","\n","MatryoshkaLoss\n","- Purpose: MatryoshkaLoss extends the idea of using multiple loss functions at different embedding dimensions. It allows us to apply a base loss function (like MultipleNegativesRankingLoss) across a series of progressively smaller embedding dimensions.

The loss values at each dimension are weighted according to specified weights and summed to get the final loss. In the code, we didn't input the weights, so the weights are set to 1 for all dimension\n","    - The loss function allows us to use smaller dimensions to speed up inference and reduce costs while
