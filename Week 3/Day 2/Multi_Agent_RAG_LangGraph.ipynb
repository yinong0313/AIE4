A striking\\nfeature of overnight rates is the presence of jumps and spikes occurring at\\npredetermined dates due to monetary policy interventions and liquidity\\nconstraints. This corresponds to stochastic discontinuities (i.e.,\\ndiscontinuities occurring at ex-ante known points in time) in their dynamics.\\nIn this work, we propose a term structure modelling framework based on\\novernight rates and characterize absence of arbitrage in a generalised\\nHeath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) setting. We extend the classical short-rate approach\\nto accommodate stochastic discontinuities, developing a tractable setup driven\\nby affine semimartingales. In this context, we show that simple specifications\\nallow to capture stylized facts of the jump behavior of overnight rates.

We need to make sure the decision is accurate.\n",

Then the supervisor agent needs to manage and maintain context across interactions with multiple agents (e.g., search agent, research agent). The supervisor agent also must decide which agent (search or research) should act next based on the progress of the task, and the agents are designed to have specific roles (e.g., search for information vs. retrieving specific details about a paper). The LLM must ensure that each agent adheres to its role and does not stray into unrelated tasks."

Remarkably, the process was efficiently completed in just 8 hours using an 8xA800 (80G) GPU machine. \\n\\nThe team achieved this extension primarily with the help of 3.5K synthetic training samples generated by GPT-4.
