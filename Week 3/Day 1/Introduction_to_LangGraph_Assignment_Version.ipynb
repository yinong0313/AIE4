        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

              "\n",

              "3. **Generation**: Finally, a generative model, such as GPT-3 or BERT, is used to generate a response based on the augmented input. The generative model can produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses because it has access to the additional information retrieved in the first step.\n",
              "\n",

              "   'output': \"The Transformer model handles the order of sequences without recurrent layers by using a mechanism called **positional encoding**. Here's a detailed explanation of how it works:\\n\\n### Positional Encoding\\n\\n1. **Purpose**: Since the Transformer model does not have any inherent notion of the order of the input tokens (unlike RNNs or LSTMs which process tokens sequentially), it needs a way to incorporate information about the position of each token in the sequence.\\n\\n2. **Mechanism**: Positional encoding is added to the input embeddings to provide the model with information about the position of each token. This encoding is a fixed-size vector that is added to the input embeddings before they are fed into the Transformer layers.\\n\\n3. **Formulation**: The positional encoding vectors are designed to have unique values for each position and are typically generated using sine and cosine functions of different frequencies. The formula for the positional encoding for a position \\\\( pos \\\\) and dimension \\\\( i \\\\) is as follows:\\n   \\\\[\\n   PE_{(pos, 2i)} = \\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}}\\\\right)\\n   \\\\]\\n   \\\\[\\n   PE_{(pos, 2i+1)} = \\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}}\\\\right)\\n   \\\\]\\n   where \\\\( d_{model} \\\\) is the dimension of the model.\\n\\n4. **Properties**: These sine and cosine functions ensure that each position has a unique encoding and that the encodings for nearby positions are similar, which helps the model to learn the relative positions of tokens.\\n\\n### Example\\n\\nConsider a sequence of tokens: \\\\([ \\\\text{token}_1, \\\\text{token}_2, \\\\text{token}_3, \\\\ldots, \\\\text{token}_n ]\\\\).\\n\\n- Each token is first converted into an embedding vector.\\n- Positional encodings are then generated for each position in the sequence.\\n- These positional encodings are added to the corresponding token embeddings.\\n- The resulting vectors (token embeddings + positional encodings) are then fed into the Transformer layers.\\n\\n### Benefits\\n\\n- **Parallelization**: Unlike RNNs, which process tokens sequentially, the use of positional encoding allows the Transformer to process all tokens in the sequence simultaneously, enabling efficient parallelization.\\n- **Flexibility**: The model can handle sequences of varying lengths and can generalize to longer sequences than those seen during training.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nBy incorporating positional encodings, the Transformer model effectively captures the order of sequences without relying on recurrent layers, allowing it to leverage the benefits of parallel processing and improved efficiency.\",\n",

              "   'output': 'The Transformer model, introduced in the paper \"Attention is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al. in 2017, has several advantages over traditional RNN-based models (such as LSTMs and GRUs). Here are some key advantages:\\n\\n1. **Parallelization**:\\n   - **Transformers**: The Transformer model allows for parallel processing of input data because it does not rely on sequential data processing. This is achieved through the self-attention mechanism, which processes all tokens in the input sequence simultaneously.\\n   - **RNNs**: RNNs process input data sequentially, which means that each step depends on the previous one. This sequential nature makes it difficult to parallelize computations, leading to slower training times.\\n\\n2. **Long-Range Dependencies**:\\n   - **Transformers**: The self-attention mechanism in Transformers can capture long-range dependencies more effectively. Each token in the input sequence can attend to all other tokens, allowing the model to learn relationships between distant tokens.\\n   - **RNNs**: RNNs, especially vanilla RNNs, struggle with long-range dependencies due to the vanishing gradient problem. While LSTMs and GRUs mitigate this issue to some extent, they still have limitations in capturing very long-range dependencies.\\n\\n3. **Scalability**:\\n   - **Transformers**: Transformers scale well with larger datasets and model sizes. The architecture is highly modular, making it easier to increase the number of layers and attention heads to improve performance.\\n   - **RNNs**: Scaling RNNs can be challenging due to the sequential nature of their computations and the difficulty in training very deep RNNs.\\n\\n4. **Memory Efficiency**:\\n   - **Transformers**: Transformers can be more memory-efficient during training because they allow for parallel processing and can leverage hardware accelerators like GPUs and TPUs more effectively.\\n   - **RNNs**: RNNs require maintaining hidden states for each time step, which can be memory-intensive, especially for long sequences.\\n\\n5. **Flexibility**:\\n   - **Transformers**: The Transformer architecture is highly flexible and has been adapted for various tasks, including natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and more. Models like BERT, GPT, and Vision Transformers (ViTs) are based on the Transformer architecture.\\n   - **RNNs**: While RNNs have been used for a variety of tasks, their architecture is less flexible compared to Transformers, and they are primarily used for sequential data.\\n\\n6. **Interpretability**:\\n   - **Transformers**: The attention mechanism in Transformers provides a level of interpretability by showing which parts of the input the model is focusing on. This can be useful for understanding model decisions.\\n   - **RNNs**: RNNs are generally less interpretable, as it is harder to visualize and understand the hidden states and their contributions to the final output.\\n\\nOverall, the Transformer model has revolutionized the field of deep learning, particularly in NLP, by addressing many of the limitations of traditional RNN-based models.',\n",

There are challenging HMM instances where Transformers struggle to learn, while RNNs can successfully do so.

Attention mechanism is a fundamental invention in artificial intelligence and machine learning, redefining the capabilities of deep learning models. This mechanism, inspired by the human mental process of selective focus, has emerged as a pillar in a variety of applications, accelerating developments in natural language processing, computer vision, and beyond. There are several types of attention mechanisms, each designed to cater to specific use cases. Here are a few notable ones: 1. Self-Attention Mechanism. Self-attention, also known as intra ...

In the Transformer series, we go over the ingredients that have made Transformers a universal recipe for machine learning. First up, we take a visual dive to understand the attention mechanism: Why transformers and attention took over. The concept of \"attention\" in deep learning has its roots in the effort to improve Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for handling longer sequences or sentences.

Fine-tuning is particularly useful in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision, where large pre-trained models like BERT, GPT, and ResNet can be adapted to specific tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, or object detection.\n",
            "\n",
            "The concept of fine-tuning has been around for a while, but it gained significant attention and popularity with the advent of deep learning and the development of large pre-trained models. One of the key moments when fine-tuning became prominent was with the introduction of the ImageNet dataset and the success of models like AlexNet in 2012. In the NLP domain, the release of models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) by Google in 2018 and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) by OpenAI in 2018-2019 brought fine-tuning into the spotlight.\n",
