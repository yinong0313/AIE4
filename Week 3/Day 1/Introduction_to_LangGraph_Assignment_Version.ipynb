        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

              "\n",
              "1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus or database. This is typically done using a retrieval model, such as BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\n",
              "\n",
              "2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input to the generative model. This means that the generative model has access to additional context or information that can help it produce more accurate and relevant responses.\n",
              "\n",
              "3. **Generation**: Finally, the generative model, such as GPT-3 or BERT, uses the augmented input to generate a response. The additional context provided by the retrieved documents helps the model generate more informed and contextually appropriate responses.\n",
              "\n",
              "RAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the generative model needs to produce responses based on a large and diverse set of information, such as in question-answering systems, chatbots, and other applications requiring detailed and accurate information retrieval."

              "   'output': \"A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system is a type of artificial intelligence model that combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to improve the quality and relevance of generated text. Here's a breakdown of the components and how they work together:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval Component**:\\n   - This part of the system is responsible for retrieving relevant information from a large corpus of documents or a database. It uses techniques from information retrieval (IR) to find documents or passages that are most relevant to a given query or context.\\n   - The retrieval component can use various methods, such as keyword matching, semantic search, or more advanced techniques like dense retrieval using embeddings.\\n\\n2. **Generation Component**:\\n   - This part of the system is responsible for generating coherent and contextually appropriate text based on the information retrieved by the retrieval component.\\n   - It typically uses a language model, such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), to generate text. The language model is fine-tuned to produce high-quality text that is relevant to the input query and the retrieved information.\\n\\n3. **Integration**:\\n   - The RAG system integrates the retrieval and generation components to produce a final response. The retrieved information is used to inform and guide the generation process, ensuring that the generated text is both relevant and accurate.\\n   - The integration can be done in various ways, such as concatenating the retrieved passages with the input query before feeding it into the language model, or using more sophisticated methods to incorporate the retrieved information into the generation process.\\n\\n### Benefits of RAG Systems:\\n- **Improved Relevance**: By leveraging a retrieval component, RAG systems can generate text that is more relevant to the input query, as they have access to a large corpus of information.\\n- **Enhanced Accuracy**: The retrieval component helps ensure that the generated text is based on factual information, reducing the likelihood of generating incorrect or misleading content.\\n- **Scalability**: RAG systems can handle a wide range of queries and topics, as they can retrieve information from a vast corpus and generate text on-the-fly.\\n\\n### Applications:\\n- **Question Answering**: RAG systems can be used to answer complex questions by retrieving relevant information and generating a coherent response.\\n- **Content Creation**: They can assist in creating content by generating text based on retrieved information, making them useful for tasks like writing articles or reports.\\n- **Customer Support**: RAG systems can be used in customer support to provide accurate and relevant responses to customer queries by retrieving information from a knowledge base and generating appropriate replies.\\n\\nOverall, Retrieval Augmented Generation systems represent a powerful approach to combining the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based methods to produce high-quality, relevant, and accurate text.\",\n",

Here are some significant improvements and benefits that the LoRA system brings:\\n\\n1. **Parameter Efficiency**: LoRA allows for fine-tuning large models with a significantly smaller number of parameters. Instead of updating all the parameters of the model, LoRA introduces low-rank matrices that adapt the pre-trained weights, which reduces the number of trainable parameters.\\n\\n2. **Memory Efficiency**: By reducing the number of parameters that need to be updated, LoRA also reduces the memory footprint during training. This makes it feasible to fine-tune large models on hardware with limited memory.\\n\\n3. **Faster Training**: With fewer parameters to update, the training process can be faster. This is particularly beneficial when working with very large models that would otherwise require extensive computational resources and time to fine-tune.\\n\\n4. **Modularity**: LoRA can be applied to different parts of the model independently. This modularity allows for more flexible and targeted fine-tuning, which can be useful in various applications.\\n\\n5. **Improved Generalization**: By focusing on low-rank adaptations, LoRA can help in preventing overfitting, leading to better generalization on unseen data.\\n\\n6. **Cost-Effectiveness**: The reduction in computational and memory requirements translates to lower costs for training and deploying models, making it more accessible for organizations with limited resources.\\n\\n7. **Compatibility**: LoRA can be integrated with existing pre-trained models without requiring significant changes to the model architecture, making it easy to adopt.\\n\\nThese improvements make LoRA a valuable technique for efficiently fine-tuning large-scale models, especially in resource-constrained environments.',\n",

Understand the steps and components of attention mechanism architecture and see examples of its applications. 1. Introduction. Self-attention, also known as scaled dot-product attention, is a fundamental concept in the field of NLP and deep learning. It plays a pivotal role in tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and sentiment analysis. Attention mechanism is a fundamental invention in artificial intelligence and machine learning, redefining the capabilities of deep learning models. This mechanism, inspired by the human mental process of selective focus, has emerged as a pillar in a variety of applications, accelerating developments in natural language processing, computer vision, and beyond. There are several types of attention mechanisms, each designed to cater to specific use cases. Here are a few notable ones: 1. Self-Attention Mechanism. Self-attention, also known as intra ...
