Some of it will travel well\\nto other regions and countries, some probably will not. Caveat\\nemptor.\\nWith all that out of the way, let’s start at the beginning: why not\\nto do a startup.\\nStartups, even in the wake of the crash of 2000, have become\\nimbued with a real mystique — you read a lot about how great\\nit is to do a startup, how much fun it is, what with the getting to\\ninvent the future, all the free meals, foosball tables, and all the\\nrest.\\nNow, it is true that there are a lot of great things about doing a\\nstartup. They include, in my experience:\\nMost fundamentally, the opportunity to be in control of your own\\ndestiny — you get to succeed or fail on your own, and you don’t\\nhave some bozo telling you what to do. For a certain kind of personality, this alone is reason enough to do a startup.\\nThe opportunity to create something new — the proverbial blank\\nsheet of paper. You have the ability — actually, the obligation\\n— to imagine a product that does not yet exist and bring it\\ninto existence, without any of the constraints normally faced by\\nlarger companies.\\nThe opportunity to have an impact on the world — to give people\\na new way to communicate, a new way to share information, a\\nnew way to work together, or anything else you can think of that\\nwould make the world a better place. Think it should be easier\\nfor low-income people to borrow money? Start Prosper. Think\\ntelevision should be opened up to an inXnite number of channels? Start Joost. Think that computers should be based on Unix\\nand open standards and not proprietary technology? Start Sun.\\nThe ability to create your ideal culture and work with a dream team\\nof people you get to assemble yourself. Want your culture to be\\nbased on people who have fun every day and enjoy working\\ntogether? Or, are hyper-competitive both in work and play? Or,\\nare super-focused on creating innovative new rocket science\\nPart 1: Why not to do a startup 3\\ntechnologies? Or, are global in perspective from day one? You\\nget to choose, and to build your culture and team to suit.\\nAnd Xnally, money — startups done right can of course be highly\\nlucrative. This is not just an issue of personal greed — when\\nthings go right, your team and employees will themselves do\\nvery well and will be able to support their families, send their\\nkids to college, and realize their dreams, and that’s really cool.\\nAnd if you’re really lucky, you as the entrepreneur can ultimately make profound philanthropic gias that change society\\nfor the better.\\nHowever, there are many more reasons to not do a startup.\\nFirst, and most importantly, realize that a startup puts you on\\nan emotional rollercoaster unlike anything you have ever experienced.\\nYou will Yip rapidly from a day in which you are euphorically\\nconvinced you are going to own the world, to a day in which\\ndoom seems only weeks away and you feel completely ruined,\\nand back again.\\nOver and over and over.\\nAnd I’m talking about what happens to stable entrepreneurs.\\nThere is so much uncertainty and so much risk around practically everything you are doing. Will the product ship on time?\\nWill it be fast enough? Will it have too many bugs? Will it be\\neasy to use? Will anyone use it? Will your competitor beat you\\nto market? Will you get any press coverage? Will anyone invest\\nin the company? Will that key new engineer join? Will your key\\nuser interface designer quit and go to Google? And on and on\\nand on…\\nSome days things will go really well and some things will go\\nreally poorly. And the level of stress that you’re under generally\\nwill magnify those transient data points into incredible highs\\nand unbelievable lows at whiplash speed and huge magnitude.\\nSound like fun?\\n4 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nSecond, in a startup, absolutely nothing happens unless you make it\\nhappen.\\nThis one throws both founders and employees new to startups.\\nIn an established company — no matter how poorly run or\\ndemoralized — things happen. They just happen. People come\\nin to work. Code gets written. User interfaces get designed.\\nServers get provisioned. Markets get analyzed. Pricing gets studied and determined. Sales calls get made. The wastebaskets get\\nemptied. And so on.\\nA startup has none of the established systems, rhythms, infrastructure that any established company has.\\nIn a startup it is very easy for the code to not get written, for the\\nuser interfaces to not get designed… for people to not come into\\nwork… and for the wastebaskets to not get emptied.\\nYou as the founder have to put all of these systems and routines\\nand habits in place and get everyone actually rowing — forget\\neven about rowing in the right direction: just rowing at all is\\nhard enough at the start.\\nAnd until you do, absolutely nothing happens.\\nUnless, of course, you do it yourself.\\nHave fun emptying those wastebaskets.\\nThird, you get told no — a lot.\\nUnless you’ve spent time in sales, you are probably not familiar\\nwith being told no a lot.\\nIt’s not so much fun.\\nGo watch Death of a Salesman and then Glengarry Glen Ross.\\nThat’s roughly what it’s like.\\nYou’re going to get told no by potential employees, potential\\ninvestors, potential customers, potential partners, reporters,\\nanalysts…\\nPart 1: Why not to do a startup 5\\nOver and over and over.\\nAnd when you do get a “yes”, half the time you’ll get a call two\\ndays later and it’ll turn out the answer has morphed into “no”.\\nBetter start working on your fake smile.\\nFourth, hiring is a huge pain in the ass.\\nYou will be amazed how many windowshoppers you’ll deal with.\\nA lot of people think they want to be part of a startup, but when\\nthe time comes to leave their cushy job at HP or Apple, they\\nYinch — and stay.\\nGoing through the recruiting process and being seduced by a\\nstartup is heady stuW for your typical engineer or midlevel manager at a big company — you get to participate vicariously in the\\nthrill of a startup without actually having to join or do any of the\\nhard work.\\nAs a founder of a startup trying to hire your team, you’ll run into\\nthis again and again.\\nWhen Jim Clark decided to start a new company in 1994, I was\\none of about a dozen people at various Silicon Valley companies\\nhe was talking to about joining him in what became Netscape.\\nI was the only one who went all the way to saying “yes” (largely\\nbecause I was 22 and had no reason not to do it).\\nThe rest Yinched and didn’t do it.\\nAnd this was Jim Clark, a legend in the industry who was coming\\noW of the most successful company in Silicon Valley in 1994 —\\nSilicon Graphics Inc.\\nHow easy do you think it’s going to be for you?\\nThen, once you do get through the windowshoppers and actually hire some people, your success rate on hiring is probably\\nnot going to be higher than 50%, and that’s if you’re good at it.\\nBy that I mean that half or more of the people you hire aren’t\\n6 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\ngoing to work out. They’re going to be too lazy, too slow, easily\\nrattled, political, bipolar, or psychotic.\\nAnd then you have to either live with them, or Xre them.\\nWhich ones of those sounds like fun?\\nFiah, God help you, at some point you’re going to have to hire executives.\\nYou think hiring employees is hard and risky — wait until you\\nstart hiring for VP Engineering, VP Marketing, VP Sales, VP HR,\\nGeneral Counsel, and CFO.\\nSixth, the hours.\\nThere’s been a lot of talk in Silicon Valley lately about work/life\\nbalance — about how you should be able to do a startup and\\nsimultaneously live a full and fulXlling outside life.\\nNow, personally, I have a lot of sympathy for that point of view.\\nAnd I try hard in my companies (well, at least my last two companies) to do whatever I can to help make sure that people aren’t\\nground down to little tiny spots on the Yoor by the workload\\nand the hours.\\nBut, it’s really diZcult.\\nThe fact is that startups are incredibly intense experiences and\\ntake a lot out of people in the best of circumstances.\\nAnd just because you want people to have work/life balance, it’s\\nnot so easy when you’re close to running out of cash, your product hasn’t shipped yet, your VC is mad at you, and your Kleiner\\nPerkins-backed competitor in Menlo Park — you know, the one\\nwhose employees’ average age seems to be about 19 — is kicking\\nyour butt.\\nWhich is what it’s going to be like most of the time.\\nAnd even if you can help your employees have proper work/life\\nbalance, as a founder you certainly won’t.\\nPart 1: Why not to do a startup 7\\n(In case you were wondering, by the way, the hours do compound the stress.)\\nSeventh, it’s really easy for the culture of a startup to go sideways.\\nThis combines the Xrst and second items above.\\nThis is the emotional rollercoaster wreaking havoc on not just\\nyou but your whole company.\\nIt takes time for the culture of any company to become “set” —\\nfor the team of people who have come together for the Xrst time\\nto decide collectively what they’re all about, what they value —\\nand how they look at challenge and adversity.\\nIn the best case, you get an amazing dynamic of people really\\npulling together, supporting one another, and working their collective tails oW in pursuit of a dream.\\nIn the worst case, you end up with widespread, self-reinforcing\\nbitterness, disillusionment, cynicism, bad morale, contempt for\\nmanagement, and depression.\\nAnd you as the founder have much less inYuence over this than\\nyou’ll think you do.\\nGuess which way it usually goes.\\nEighth, there are lots of X factors that can come along and whup\\nyou right upside the head, and there’s absolutely nothing you\\ncan do about them.\\nStock market crashes.\\nTerrorist attacks.\\nNatural disasters.\\nA better funded startup with a more experienced team that’s\\nbeen hard at work longer than you have, in stealth mode, that\\nunexpectedly releases a product that swialy comes to dominate\\nyour market, completely closing oW your opportunity, and you\\nhad no idea they were even working on it.\\n8 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nAt best, any given X factor might slam shut the fundraising\\nwindow, cause customers to delay or cancel purchases — or, at\\nworst, shut down your whole company.\\nRussian mobsters laundering millions of dollars of dirty money\\nthrough your service, resulting in the credit card companies\\nclosing you down.\\nYou think I’m joking about that one?\\nOK, now here’s the best part:\\nI haven’t even talked about Xguring out what product to build,\\nbuilding it, taking it to market, and standing out from the crowd.\\nAll the risks in the core activities of what your company actually\\ndoes are yet to come, and to be discussed in future posts in this\\nseries.\\nPart 1: Why not to do a startup 9\\nPart 2: When the VCs say \"no\"\\nThis post is about what to do between when the VCs say “no” to\\nfunding your startup, and when you either change their minds\\nor Xnd some other path.\\nI’m going to assume that you’ve done all the basics: developed a\\nplan and a pitch, decided that venture Xnancing is right for you\\nand you are right for venture Xnancing, lined up meetings with\\nproperly qualiXed VCs, and made your pitch.\\nAnd the answer has come back and it’s “no”.\\nOne “no” doesn’t mean anything — the VC could just be having\\na bad day, or she had a bad experience with another company in\\nyour category, or she had a bad experience with another company with a similar name, or she had a bad experience with\\nanother founder who kind of looks like you, or her Mercedes\\nSLR McLaren’s engine could have blown up on the freeway that\\nmorning — it could be anything. Go meet with more VCs.\\nIf you meet with three VCs and they all say “no”, it could just be\\na big coincidence. Go meet with more VCs.\\nIf you meet with Xve, or six, or eight VCs and they all say no, it’s\\nnot a coincidence.\\nThere is something wrong with your plan.\\nOr, even if there isn’t, there might as well be, because you’re still\\nnot getting funded.\\nMeeting with more VCs aaer a bunch have said no is probably\\na waste of time. Instead, retool your plan — which is what this\\npost is about.\\nBut Hrst, lay the groundwork to go back in later.\\nIt’s an old — and true — cliche that VCs rarely actually say “no”\\n— more oaen they say “maybe”, or “not right now”, or “my partners aren’t sure”, or “that’s interesting, let me think about it”.\\nThey do that because they don’t want to invest in your company\\ngiven the current facts, but they want to keep the door open in\\ncase the facts change.\\nAnd that’s exactly what you want — you want to be able to go\\nback to them with a new set of facts, and change their minds,\\nand get to “yes”.\\nSo be sure to take “no” gracefully — politely ask them for feedback (which they probably won’t give you, at least not completely honestly — nobody likes calling someone else’s baby\\nugly — believe me, I’ve done it), thank them for their time, and\\nask if you can call them again if things change.\\nTrust me — they’d much rather be saying “yes” than “no” —\\nthey need all the good investments they can get.\\nSecond, consider the environment.\\nBeing told “no” by VCs in 1999 is a lot diWerent than being told\\n“no” in 2002.\\nIf you were told “no” in 1999, I’m sure you’re a wonderful person and you have huge potential and your mother loves you\\nvery much, but your plan really was seriously Yawed.\\nIf you were told “no” in 2002, you probably actually were the\\nnext Google, but most of the VCs were hiding under their desks\\nand they just missed it.\\nIn my opinion, we’re now in a much more rational environment\\nthan either of those extremes — a lot of good plans are being\\nfunded, along with some bad ones, but not all the bad ones.\\nPart 2: When the VCs say \"no\" 11\\nI’ll proceed under the assumption that we’re in normal times.\\nBut if things get truly euphoric or truly funereal again, the rest\\nof this post will probably not be very helpful — in either case.\\nThird, retool your plan.\\nThis is the hard part — changing the facts of your plan and what\\nyou are trying to do, to make your company more fundable.\\nTo describe the dimensions that you should consider as you\\ncontemplate retooling your plan, let me introduce the onion\\ntheory of risk.\\nIf you’re an investor, you look at the risk around an investment\\nas if it’s an onion. Just like you peel an onion and remove each\\nlayer in turn, risk in a startup investment comes in layers that\\nget peeled away — reduced — one by one.\\nYour challenge as an entrepreneur trying to raise venture capital\\nis to keep peeling layers of risk oW of your particular onion until\\nthe VCs say “yes” — until the risk in your startup is reduced to\\nthe point where investing in your startup doesn’t look terrifying\\nand merely looks risky.\\nWhat are the layers of risk for a high-tech\\nstartup?\\nIt depends on the startup, but here are some of the common\\nones:\\nFounder risk — does the startup have the right founding team?\\nA common founding team might include a great technologist,\\nplus someone who can run the company, at least to start. Is the\\ntechnologist really all that? Is the business person capable of\\nrunning the company? Is the business person missing from the\\nteam altogether? Is it a business person or business people with\\nno technologist, and therefore virtually unfundable?\\nMarket risk — is there a market for the product (using the term\\nproduct and service interchangeably)? Will anyone want it? Will\\nthey pay for it? How much will they pay? How do we know?\\n12 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nCompetition risk — are there too many other startups already\\ndoing this? Is this startup suZciently diWerentiated from the\\nother startups, and also diWerentiated from any large incumbents?\\nTiming risk — is it too early? Is it too late?\\nFinancing risk — aaer we invest in this round, how many additional rounds of Xnancing will be required for the company to\\nbecome proXtable, and what will the dollar total be? How certain\\nare we about these estimates? How do we know?\\nMarketing risk — will this startup be able to cut through the\\nnoise? How much will marketing cost? Do the economics of customer acquisition — the cost to acquire a customer, and the revenue that customer will generate — work?\\nDistribution risk — does this startup need certain distribution\\npartners to succeed? Will it be able to get them? How? (For\\nexample, this is a common problem with mobile startups that\\nneed deals with major mobile carriers to succeed.)\\nTechnology risk — can the product be built? Does it involve rocket\\nscience — or an equivalent, like artiXcial intelligence or natural\\nlanguage processing? Are there fundamental breakthroughs that\\nneed to happen? If so, how certain are we that they will happen,\\nor that this team will be able to make them?\\nProduct risk — even assuming the product can in theory be built,\\ncan this team build it?\\nHiring risk — what positions does the startup need to hire for in\\norder to execute its plan? E.g. a startup planning to build a highscale web service will need a VP of Operations — will the founding team be able to hire a good one?\\nLocation risk — where is the startup located? Can it hire the right\\ntalent in that location? And will I as the VC need to drive more\\nthan 20 minutes in my Mercedes SLR McLaren to get there?\\nYou know, when you stack up all these layers and look at the\\nPart 2: When the VCs say \"no\" 13\\nfull onion, you realize it’s amazing that any venture investments\\never get made.\\nWhat you need to do is take a hard-headed look at each of these\\nrisks — and any others that are speciXc to your startup and its\\ncategory — and put yourself in the VC’s shoes: what could this\\nstartup do to minimize or eliminate enough of these risks to\\nmake the company fundable?\\nThen do those things.\\nThis isn’t very much fun, since it will probably involve making\\nsigniXcant changes to your plan, but look on the bright side: it’s\\nexcellent practice for when your company ultimately goes public and has to Xle an S1 registration statement with the SEC, in\\nwhich you have to itemize in huge detail every conceivable risk\\nand bad thing that could ever possibly happen to you, up to and\\nincluding global warming.\\nSome ideas on reducing risk\\nFounder risk — the tough one. If you’re the technologist on a\\nfounding team with a business person, you have to consider the\\npossibility that the VCs don’t think the business person is strong\\nenough to be the founding CEO. Or vice versa, maybe they\\nthink the technologist isn’t strong enough to build the product.\\nYou may have to swap out one or more founders, and/or add\\none or more founders.\\nI put this one right up front because it can be a huge issue and\\nthe odds of someone being honest with you about it in the speciXc are not that high.\\nMarket risk — you probably need to validate the market, at a\\npractical level. Sometimes more detailed and analytical market\\nresearch will solve the problem, but more oaen you actually\\nneed to go get some customers to demonstrate that the market\\nexists. Preferably, paying customers. Or at least credible\\nprospects who will talk to VCs to validate the market hypothesis.\\nCompetition risk — is your diWerentiation really sharp enough?\\n14 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nRethink this one from the ground up. Lots of startups do not\\nhave strong enough diWerentiation out of the gate, even aaer\\nthey get funded. If you don’t have a really solid idea as to how\\nyou’re dramatically diWerent from or advantaged over known\\nand unknown competitors, you might not want to start a company in the Xrst place.\\nTwo additional points on competition risk that founders routinely screw up in VC pitches:\\nNever, ever say that you have no competitors. That signals\\nnaivete. Great markets draw competitors, and so if you really\\nhave no competition, you must not be in a great market. Even\\nif you really believe you have no competitors, create a competitive landscape slide with adjacent companies in related market\\nsegments and be ready to talk crisply about how you are like and\\nunlike those adjacent companies.\\nAnd never, ever say your market projections indicate you’re\\ngoing to be hugely successful if you get only 2% of your\\n(extremely large) market. That also signals naivete. If you’re\\ngoing aaer 2% of a large market, that means the presumably\\nlarger companies that are going to take the other 98% are going\\nto kill you. You have to have a theory for how you’re going to get\\na signiXcantly higher market share than 2%. (I pick 2% because\\nthat’s the cliche, but if you’re a VC, you’ve probably heard someone use it.)\\nTiming risk — the only thing to do here is to make more\\nprogress, and demonstrate that you’re not too early or too late.\\nGetting customers in the bag is the most valuable thing you can\\ndo on this one.\\nFinancing risk — rethink very carefully how much money you\\nwill need to raise aaer this round of Xnancing, and try to change\\nthe plan in plausible ways to require less money. For example,\\nonly serve Cristal at your launch party, and not Remy Martin\\n“Black Pearl” Louis XIII cognac.\\nMarketing risk — Xrst, make sure your diWerentiation is superPart 2: When the VCs say \"no\" 15\\nsharp, because without that, you probably won’t be able to stand\\nout from the noise.\\nThen, model out your customer acquisition economics in detail\\nand make sure that you can show how you’ll get more revenue\\nfrom a customer than it will cost in sales and marketing expense\\nto acquire that customer. This is a common problem for startups pursuing the small business market, for example.\\nIf it turns out you need a lot of money in absolute terms for\\nmarketing, look for alternate approaches — perhaps guerilla\\nmarketing, or some form of virality.\\nDistribution risk — this is a very tough one — if your plan has\\ndistribution risk, which is to say you need a key distribution\\npartner to make it work, personally I’d recommend shelving the\\nplan and doing something else. Otherwise, you may need to go\\nget the distribution deal before you can raise money, which is\\nalmost impossible.\\nTechnology risk — there’s only one way around this, which is to\\nbuild the product, or at least get it to beta, and then raise money.\\nProduct risk — same answer — build it.\\nHiring risk — the best way to address this is to Xgure out which\\nposition/positions the VCs are worried about, and add it/them\\nto the founding team. This will mean additional dilution for\\nyou, but it’s probably the only way to solve the problem.\\nLocation risk — this is the one you’re really not going to like. If\\nyou’re not in a major center of entrepreneurialism and you’re\\nhaving trouble raising money, you probably need to move.\\nThere’s a reason why most Xlms get made in Los Angeles, and\\nthere’s a reason most venture-backed US tech startups happen\\nin Silicon Valley and handful of other places — that’s where the\\nmoney is. You can start a company wherever you want, but you\\nmay not be able to get it funded there.\\nYou’ll notice that a lot of what you may need to do is kick the ball\\nfurther down the road — make more progress against your plan\\nbefore you raise venture capital.\\n16 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nThis obviously raises the issue of how you’re supposed to do\\nthat before you’ve raised money.\\nTry to raise angel money, or bootstrap oW of initial customers\\nor consulting contracts, or work on it aaer hours while keeping\\nyour current job, or quit your job and live oW of credit cards for\\na while.\\nLots of entrepreneurs have done these things and succeeded —\\nand of course, many have failed.\\nNobody said this would be easy.\\nThe most valuable thing you can do is actually build your product. When in doubt, focus on that.\\nThe next most valuable thing you can do is get customers — or,\\nfor a consumer Internet service, establish a pattern of page view\\ngrowth.\\nThe whole theory of venture capital is that VCs are investing\\nin risk — another term for venture capital is “risk capital” —\\nbut the reality is that VCs will only take on so much risk, and\\nthe best thing you can do to optimize your chances of raising\\nmoney is to take out risk.\\nPeel away at the onion.\\nThen, once you’ve done that, recraa the pitch around the new\\nfacts. Go do the pitches again. And repeat as necessary.\\nAnd to end on a happy note, remember that “yes” can turn into\\n“no” at any point up until the cash hits your company’s bank\\naccount.\\nSo keep your options open all the way to the end.\\nPart 2: When the VCs say \"no\" 17\\nPart 3: \"But I don\\'t know any VCs!\"\\nIn my last post in this series, When the VCs say “no”, I discussed\\nwhat to do once you have been turned down for venture funding for the Xrst time.\\nHowever, this presupposes you’ve been able to pitch VCs in the\\nXrst place. What if you have a startup for which you’d like to\\nraise venture funding, but you don’t know any VCs?\\nI can certainly sympathize with this problem — when I was in\\ncollege working on Mosaic at the University of Illinois, the term\\n“venture capital” might as well have been “klaatu barada nikto”\\nfor all I knew. I had never met a venture capitalist, no venture\\ncapitalist had ever talked to me, and I wouldn’t have recognized\\none if I’d stumbled over his checkbook on the sidewalk. Without\\nJim Clark, I’m not at all certain I would have been able to raise\\nmoney to start a company like Netscape, had it even occured to\\nme to start a company in the Xrst place.\\nThe starting point for raising money from VCs when you don’t\\nknow any VCs is to realize that VCs work mostly through referrals — they hear about a promising startup or entrepreneur\\nfrom someone they have worked with before, like another\\nentrepreneur, an executive or engineer at one of the startups\\nthey have funded, or an angel investor with whom they have\\npreviously co-invested.\\nThe reason for this is simply the math: any individual VC can\\nonly fund a few companies per year, and for every one she\\nfunds, she probably meets with 15 or 20, and there are hundreds\\nmore that would like to meet with her that she doesn’t possibly\\nhave time to meet with. She has to rely on her network to help\\nher screen the hundreds down to 15 or 20, so she can spend her\\ntime Xnding the right one out of the 15 or 20.\\nTherefore, submitting a business plan “over the transom”, or\\nunsolicited, to a venture Xrm is likely to amount to just as much\\nas submitting a screenplay “over the transom” to a Hollywood\\ntalent agency — that is, precisely nothing.\\nSo the primary trick becomes getting yourself into a position\\nwhere you’re one of the 15 or 20 a particular venture capitalist\\nis meeting with based on referrals from her network, not one of\\nthe hundreds of people who don’t come recommended by anyone and whom she has no intention of meeting.\\nBut before you think about doing that, the Xrst order of business\\nis to (paraphrasing for a family audience) “have your stuG\\ntogether” — create and develop your plan, your presentation,\\nand your supporting materials so that when you do meet with a\\nVC, you impress her right out of the gate as bringing her a fundable startup founded by someone who knows what he — that’s\\nyou — is doing.\\nMy recommendation is to read up on all the things you should\\ndo to put together a really eWective business plan and presentation, and then pretend you have already been turned down once\\n— then go back to my last post and go through all the diWerent\\nthings you should anticipate and Xx before you actually do walk\\nthrough the door.\\nOne of the reason VCs only meet with startups through their\\nnetworks is because too many of the hundreds of other startups\\nthat they could meet with come across as amateurish and uninformed, and therefore not fundable, when they do take meetings with them. So you have a big opportunity to cut through\\nthe noise by making a great Hrst impression — which requires\\nreally thinking things through ahead of time and doing all the\\nhard work up front to really make your pitch and plan a masterpiece.\\nPart 3: \"But I don\\'t know any VCs!\" 19\\nWorking backwards from that, the best thing you can walk in\\nwith is a working product. Or, if you can’t get to a working\\nproduct without raising venture funding, then at least a beta\\nor prototype of some form — a web site that works but hasn’t\\nlaunched, or a soaware mockup with partial functionality,\\nor something. And of course it’s even better if you walk in with\\nexisting “traction” of some form — customers, beta customers,\\nsome evidence of adoption by Internet users, whatever is appropriate for your particular startup.\\nWith a working product that could be the foundation of a fundable startup, you have a much better chance of getting funded\\nonce you do get in the door. Back to my rule of thumb from\\nthe last post: when in doubt, work on the product.\\nFailing a working product and ideally customers or users, be\\nsure to have as Ieshed out a presentation as you possibly can\\n— including mockups, screenshots, market analyses, customer\\nresearch such as interviews with real prospects, and the like.\\nDon’t bother with a long detailed written business plan. Most\\nVCs will either fund a startup based on a Yeshed out Powerpoint\\npresentation of about 20 slides, or they won’t fund it at all.\\nCorollary: any VC who requires a long detailed written business\\nplan is probably not the right VC to be working with.\\nNext: qualify, qualify, qualify. Do extensive research on venture capitalists and Xnd the ones who focus on the sector relevant to your startup. It is completely counterproductive to\\neveryone involved for you to pitch a health care VC on a consumer Internet startup, or vice versa. Individual VCs are usually\\nquite focused in the kinds of companies they are looking for,\\nand identifying those VCs and screening out all the others is\\nabsolutely key.\\nNow, on to developing contacts\\nThe best way to develop contacts with VCs, in my opinion, is to\\nwork at a venture-backed startup, kick butt, get promoted, and\\nnetwork the whole way.\\n20 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nIf you can’t get hired by a venture-backed startup right now,\\nwork at a well-regarded large tech company that employs a lot\\nof people like Google or Apple, gain experience, and then go to\\nwork at a venture-backed startup, kick butt, get promoted, and\\nnetwork the whole way.\\nAnd if you can’t get hired by a well-regarded large tech company, go get a bachelor’s or master’s degree at a major research\\nuniversity from which well-regarded large tech companies regularly recruit, then work at a well-regarded large tech company\\nthat employs a lot of people like Google or Apple, gain experience, and then go to work at a venture-backed startup, kick butt,\\nget promoted, and network the whole way.\\nI sound like I’m joking, but I’m completely serious — this is the\\npath taken by many venture-backed entrepreneurs I know.\\nSome alternate techniques that don’t take\\nquite as long\\nIf you’re still in school, immediately transfer to, or plan on\\ngoing to graduate school at, a large research university with\\nwell-known connections to the venture capital community, like\\nStanford or MIT.\\nGraduate students at Stanford are directly responsible for such\\ncompanies as Sun, Cisco, Yahoo, and Google, so needless to say,\\nSilicon Valley VCs are continually on the prowl on the Stanford\\nengineering campus for the next Jerry Yang or Larry Page.\\n(In contrast, the University of Illinois, where I went to school, is\\nmostly prowled by mutant cold-weather cows.)\\nAlternately, jump all over Y Combinator. This program, created by entrepreneur Paul Graham and his partners, funds\\nearly-stage startups in an organized program in Silicon Valley\\nand Boston and then makes sure the good ones get in front of\\nventure capitalists for follow-on funding. It’s a great idea and a\\nhuge opportunity for the people who participate in it.\\nPart 3: \"But I don\\'t know any VCs!\" 21\\nRead VC blogs — read them all, and read them very very carefully. VCs who blog are doing entrepreneurs a huge service both\\nin conveying highly useful information as well as frequently\\nputting themselves out there to be contacted by entrepreneurs\\nin various ways including email, comments, and even uploaded\\npodcasts. Each VC is diWerent in terms of how she wants to\\nengage with people online, but by all means read as many VC\\nblogs as you can and interact with as many of them as you can\\nin appropriate ways.\\nAt the very least you will start to get a really good sense of which\\nVCs who blog are interested in which kinds of companies.\\nAt best, a VC blogger may encourage her readers to communicate with her in various ways, including soliciting email pitches\\nin certain startup categories of interest to her.\\nFred Wilson of Union Square Ventures has even gone so far as\\nto encourage entrepreneurs to record and upload audio pitches\\nfor new ventures so he can listen to them on his IPod. I don’t\\nknow if he’s still doing that, but it’s worth reading his blog and\\nXnding out.\\nAlong those lines, some VCs are aggressive early adopters of\\nnew forms of communication and interaction — current examples being Facebook and Twitter. Observationally, when a VC is\\nexploring a new communiation medium like Facebook or Twitter, she can be more interested in interacting with various people over that new medium than she might otherwise be. So,\\nwhen such a new thing comes out — like, hint hint, Facebook or\\nTwitter — jump all over it, see which VCs are using it, and interact with them that way — sensibly, of course.\\nMore generally, it’s a good idea for entrepreneurs who are\\nlooking for funding to blog — about their startup, about interesting things going on, about their point of view. This puts an\\nentrepreneur in the Yow of conversation, which can lead to\\ninteraction with VCs through the normal medium of blogging.\\nAnd, when a VC does decide to take a look at you and your company, she can read your blog to get a sense of who you are and\\n22 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nhow you think. It’s another great opportunity to put forward a\\nfantastic Xrst impression.\\nFinally, if you are a programmer, I highly encourage you, if you\\nhave time, to create or contribute to a meaningful open source\\nproject. The open source movement is an amazing opportunity\\nfor programmers all over the world to not only build useful\\nsoaware that lots of people can use, but also build their own reputations completely apart from whatever day jobs they happen\\nto have. Being able to email a VC and say, “I’m the creator of\\nopen source program X which has 50,000 users worldwide, and\\nI want to tell you about my new startup” is a lot more eWective\\nthan your normal pitch.\\nIf you engage in a set of these techniques over time,\\nyou should be able to interact with at least a few VCs in ways that\\nthey Xnd useful and that might lead to further conversations\\nabout funding, or even introductions to other VCs.\\nI’m personally hoping that the next Google comes out of a VC\\nbeing sent an email pitch aaer the entrepreneur read that VC’s\\nblog. Then every VC on the planet will suddenly start blogging,\\novernight.\\nIf none of those ideas work for you\\nYour alternatives in reverse (declining) order of preference for\\nfunding are, in my view: angel funding, bootstrapping via consulting contracts or early customers, keeping your day job and\\nworking on your startup in your spare time, and credit card\\ndebt.\\nAngel funding — funding from individuals who like to invest\\nsmall amounts of money in early-stage startups, oaen before\\nVCs come in — can be a great way to go since good angels know\\ngood VCs and will be eager to introduce you to them so that\\nyour company goes on to be successful for the angel as well as\\nfor you.\\nPart 3: \"But I don\\'t know any VCs!\" 23\\nThis of course begs the question of how to raise angel money,\\nwhich is another topic altogether!\\nI am not encouraging the other three alternatives — bootstrapping, working on it part time, or credit card debt. Each has\\nserious problems. But, it is easy to name highly successful entrepreneurs who have followed each of those paths, so they are\\nworth noting.\\n24 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nPart 4: The only thing that matters\\nThis post is all about the only thing that matters for a new\\nstartup.\\nBut Xrst, some theory:\\nIf you look at a broad cross-section of startups — say, 30 or 40\\nor more; enough to screen out the pure Yukes and look for patterns — two obvious facts will jump out at you.\\nFirst obvious fact: there is an incredibly wide divergence of success — some of those startups are insanely successful, some\\nhighly successful, many somewhat successful, and quite a few of\\ncourse outright fail.\\nSecond obvious fact: there is an incredibly wide divergence of\\ncaliber and quality for the three core elements of each startup\\n— team, product, and market.\\nAt any given startup, the team will range from outstanding to\\nremarkably Yawed; the product will range from a masterpiece\\nof engineering to barely functional; and the market will range\\nfrom booming to comatose.\\nAnd so you start to wonder — what correlates the most to success — team, product, or market? Or, more bluntly, what causes\\nsuccess? And, for those of us who are students of startup failure\\n— what’s most dangerous: a bad team, a weak product, or a\\npoor market?\\nLet’s start by deXning terms.\\nThe caliber of a startup team can be deXned as the suitability of\\nthe CEO, senior staW, engineers, and other key staW relative to\\nthe opportunity in front of them.\\nYou look at a startup and ask, will this team be able to optimally\\nexecute against their opportunity? I focus on eWectiveness as\\nopposed to experience, since the history of the tech industry is\\nfull of highly successful startups that were staWed primarily by\\npeople who had never “done it before”.\\nThe quality of a startup’s product can be deXned as how impressive the product is to one customer or user who actually uses\\nit: How easy is the product to use? How feature rich is it? How\\nfast is it? How extensible is it? How polished is it? How many (or\\nrather, how few) bugs does it have?\\nThe size of a startup’s market is the the number, and growth\\nrate, of those customers or users for that product.\\n(Let’s assume for this discussion that you can make money at\\nscale — that the cost of acquiring a customer isn’t higher than\\nthe revenue that customer will generate.)\\nSome people have been objecting to my classiXcation as follows:\\n“How great can a product be if nobody wants it?” In other words,\\nisn’t the quality of a product deXned by how appealing it is to\\nlots of customers?\\nNo. Product quality and market size are completely diWerent.\\nHere’s the classic scenario: the world’s best soaware application\\nfor an operating system nobody runs. Just ask any soaware\\ndeveloper targeting the market for BeOS, Amiga, OS/2, or\\nNeXT applications what the diWerence is between great product\\nand big market.\\nSo:\\nIf you ask entrepreneurs or VCs which of team, product, or market is most important, many will say team. This is the obvious\\n26 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nanswer, in part because in the beginning of a startup, you know\\na lot more about the team than you do the product, which hasn’t\\nbeen built yet, or the market, which hasn’t been explored yet.\\nPlus, we’ve all been raised on slogans like “people are our most\\nimportant asset” — at least in the US, pro-people sentiments\\npermeate our culture, ranging from high school self-esteem\\nprograms to the Declaration of Independence’s inalienable\\nrights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness — so the\\nanswer that team is the most important feels right.\\nAnd who wants to take the position that people don’t matter?\\nOn the other hand, if you ask engineers, many will say product.\\nThis is a product business, startups invent products, customers\\nbuy and use the products. Apple and Google are the best companies in the industry today because they build the best products. Without the product there is no company. Just try having\\na great team and no product, or a great market and no product.\\nWhat’s wrong with you? Now let me get back to work on the\\nproduct.\\nPersonally, I’ll take the third position — I’ll assert that market is\\nthe most important factor in a startup’s success or failure.\\nWhy?\\nIn a great market — a market with lots of real potential customers — the market pulls product out of the startup.\\nThe market needs to be fulXlled and the market will be fulXlled,\\nby the Xrst viable product that comes along.\\nThe product doesn’t need to be great; it just has to basically\\nwork. And, the market doesn’t care how good the team is, as\\nlong as the team can produce that viable product.\\nIn short, customers are knocking down your door to get the\\nproduct; the main goal is to actually answer the phone and\\nrespond to all the emails from people who want to buy.\\nPart 4: The only thing that matters 27\\nAnd when you have a great market, the team is remarkably easy\\nto upgrade on the Yy.\\nThis is the story of search keyword advertising, and Internet\\nauctions, and TCP/IP routers.\\nConversely, in a terrible market, you can have the best product\\nin the world and an absolutely killer team, and it doesn’t matter — you’re going to fail.\\nYou’ll break your pick for years trying to Xnd customers who\\ndon’t exist for your marvelous product, and your wonderful\\nteam will eventually get demoralized and quit, and your startup\\nwill die.\\nThis is the story of videoconferencing, and workYow soaware,\\nand micropayments.\\nIn honor of Andy RachleW, formerly of Benchmark Capital, who\\ncrystallized this formulation for me, let me present RachleE’s\\nLaw of Startup Success:\\nThe #1 company-killer is lack of market.\\nAndy puts it this way:\\n• When a great team meets a lousy market, market wins.\\n• When a lousy team meets a great market, market wins.\\n• When a great team meets a great market, something special\\nhappens.\\nYou can obviously screw up a great market — and that has been\\ndone, and not infrequently — but assuming the team is baseline\\ncompetent and the product is fundamentally acceptable, a great\\nmarket will tend to equal success and a poor market will tend to\\nequal failure. Market matters most.\\nAnd neither a stellar team nor a fantastic product will redeem a\\nbad market.\\nOK, so what?\\n28 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nWell, Hrst question: Since team is the thing you have the most\\ncontrol over at the start, and everyone wants to have a great\\nteam, what does a great team actually get you?\\nHopefully a great team gets you at least an OK product, and ideally a great product.\\nHowever, I can name you a bunch of examples of great teams\\nthat totally screwed up their products. Great products are really,\\nreally hard to build.\\nHopefully a great team also gets you a great market — but I can\\nalso name you lots of examples of great teams that executed\\nbrilliantly against terrible markets and failed. Markets that don’t\\nexist don’t care how smart you are.\\nIn my experience, the most frequent case of great team paired\\nwith bad product and/or terrible market is the second- or thirdtime entrepreneur whose Xrst company was a huge success.\\nPeople get cocky, and slip up. One highly successful soaware\\nentrepreneur is burning through something like $80 million in\\nventure funding in his latest startup and has practically nothing\\nto show for it except for some great press clippings and a couple of beta customers — because there is virtually no market for\\nwhat he is building.\\nConversely, I can name you any number of weak teams whose\\nstartups were highly successful due to explosively large markets\\nfor what they were doing.\\nFinally, to quote Tim Shephard: “A great team is a team that will\\nalways beat a mediocre team, given the same market and product.”\\nSecond question: Can’t great products sometimes create huge\\nnew markets?\\nAbsolutely.\\nThis is a best case scenario, though.\\nVMWare is the most recent company to have done it —\\nPart 4: The only thing that matters 29\\nVMWare’s product was so profoundly transformative out of the\\ngate that it catalyzed a whole new movement toward operating\\nsystem virtualization, which turns out to be a monster market.\\nAnd of course, in this scenario, it also doesn’t really matter\\nhow good your team is, as long as the team is good enough to\\ndevelop the product to the baseline level of quality the market\\nrequires and get it fundamentally to market.\\nUnderstand I’m not saying that you should shoot low in terms of quality\\nof team, or that VMWare’s team was not incredibly strong —\\nit was, and is. I’m saying, bring a product as transformative as\\nVMWare’s to market and you’re going to succeed, full stop.\\nShort of that, I wouldn’t count on your product creating a new\\nmarket from scratch.\\nThird question: as a startup founder, what should I do about\\nall this?\\nLet’s introduce RachleE’s Corollary of Startup Success:\\nThe only thing that matters is getting to product/market Ft.\\nProduct/market Xt means being in a good market with a product\\nthat can satisfy that market.\\nYou can always feel when product/market Ft isn’t happening. The\\ncustomers aren’t quite getting value out of the product, word\\nof mouth isn’t spreading, usage isn’t growing that fast, press\\nreviews are kind of “blah”, the sales cycle takes too long, and lots\\nof deals never close.\\nAnd you can always feel product/market Ft when it’s happening. The\\ncustomers are buying the product just as fast as you can make it\\n— or usage is growing just as fast as you can add more servers.\\nMoney from customers is piling up in your company checking\\naccount. You’re hiring sales and customer support staW as fast as\\nyou can. Reporters are calling because they’ve heard about your\\nhot new thing and they want to talk to you about it. You start\\ngetting entrepreneur of the year awards from Harvard Busi30 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nness School. Investment bankers are staking out your house. You\\ncould eat free for a year at Buck’s.\\nLots of startups fail before product/market Ht ever happens.\\nMy contention, in fact, is that they fail because they never get to\\nproduct/market Xt.\\nCarried a step further, I believe that the life of any startup can be\\ndivided into two parts: before product/market Ft (call this “BPMF”)\\nand aMer product/market Ft (“APMF”).\\nWhen you are BPMF, focus obsessively on getting to product/\\nmarket Ht.\\nDo whatever is required to get to product/market Ht. Including\\nchanging out people, rewriting your product, moving into a different market, telling customers no when you don’t want to,\\ntelling customers yes when you don’t want to, raising that fourth\\nround of highly dilutive venture capital — whatever is required.\\nWhen you get right down to it, you can ignore almost everything else.\\nI’m not suggesting that you do ignore everything else — just that\\njudging from what I’ve seen in successful startups, you can.\\nWhenever you see a successful startup, you see one that has\\nreached product/market Ht — and usually along the way\\nscrewed up all kinds of other things, from channel model to\\npipeline development strategy to marketing plan to press relations to compensation policies to the CEO sleeping with the\\nventure capitalist. And the startup is still successful.\\nConversely, you see a surprising number of really well-run\\nstartups that have all aspects of operations completely buttoned\\ndown, HR policies in place, great sales model, thoroughly\\nthought-through marketing plan, great interview processes,\\noutstanding catered food, 30″ monitors for all the programmers, top tier VCs on the board — heading straight oG a cliG\\ndue to not ever Hnding product/market Ht.\\nPart 4: The only thing that matters 31\\nIronically, once a startup is successful, and you ask the founders\\nwhat made it successful, they will usually cite all kinds of things\\nthat had nothing to do with it. People are terrible at understanding causation. But in almost every case, the cause was actually\\nproduct/market Xt.\\nBecause, really, what else could it possibly be?\\n[Editorial note: this post obviously raises way more questions than it\\nanswers. How exactly do you go about getting to product/market Ft if\\nyou don’t hit it right out of the gate? How do you evaluate markets for\\nsize and quality, especially before they’re fully formed? What actually\\nmakes a product “Ft” a market? What role does timing play? How do\\nyou know when to change strategy and go aMer a diEerent market or\\nbuild a diEerent product?

Ross Browne’s Etchings of a Whaling Cruize, 1846\\nThere are times in the life of a startup when you have to deal\\nwith big companies.\\nMaybe you’re looking for a partnership or distribution deal.\\nPerhaps you want an investment. Sometimes you want a marketing or sales alliance. From time to time you need a big com-\\npany’s permission to do something. Or maybe a big company\\nhas approached you and says it wants to buy your startup.\\nThe most important thing you need to know going into any discussion or interaction with a big company is that you’re Captain\\nAhab, and the big company is Moby Dick.\\n“Scarcely had we proceeded two days on the sea, when about sunrise a great many Whales and other monsters of the sea, appeared.\\nAmong the former, one was of a most monstrous size. … This came\\ntowards us, open-mouthed, raising the waves on all sides, and beating the sea before him into a foam.”\\n— Tooke’s Lucian, “The True History”\\nWhen Captain Ahab went in search of the great white whale\\nMoby Dick, he had absolutely no idea whether he would Xnd\\nMoby Dick, whether Moby Dick would allow himself to be\\nfound, whether Moby Dick would try to immediately capsize\\nthe ship or instead play cat and mouse, or whether Moby Dick\\nwas oW mating with his giant whale girlfriend.\\nWhat happened was entirely up to Moby Dick.\\nAnd Captain Ahab would never be able explain to himself or\\nanyone else why Moby Dick would do whatever it was he’d do.\\nYou’re Captain Ahab, and the big company is Moby Dick.\\n“Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt Xnd that he\\nhas only one leg.”\\n“What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?”\\n“Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured,\\nchewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever\\nchipped a boat! — ah, ah!”\\n— Moby Dick\\nHere’s why:\\nThe behavior of any big company is largely inexplicable when\\nviewed from the outside.\\n34 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nI always laugh when someone says, “Microsoa is going to do X”,\\nor “Google is going to do Y”, or “Yahoo is going to do Z”.\\nOdds are, nobody inside Microsoa, Google, or Yahoo knows\\nwhat Microsoa, Google, or Yahoo is going to do in any given circumstance on any given issue.\\nSure, maybe the CEO knows, if the issue is really big, but you’re\\nprobably not dealing at the CEO level, and so that doesn’t matter.\\nThe inside of any big company is a very, very complex system\\nconsisting of many thousands of people, of whom at least hundreds and probably thousands are executives who think they\\nhave some level of decision-making authority.\\nOn any given issue, many people inside the company are going\\nto get some kind of vote on what happens — maybe 8 people,\\nmaybe 10, 15, 20, sometimes many more.\\nWhen I was at IBM in the early 90’s, they had a formal decision\\nmaking process called “concurrence” — on any given issue, a\\nwritten list of the 50 or so executives from all over the company\\nwho would be aWected by the decision in any way, no matter\\nhow minor, would be assembled, and any one of those executives could “nonconcur” and veto the decision. That’s an\\nextreme case, but even a non-extreme version of this process —\\nand all big companies have one; they have to — is mind-bendingly complex to try to understand, even from the inside, let\\nalone the outside.\\n“… and the breath of the whale is frequently attended with such an\\ninsupportable smell, as to bring on a disorder of the brain.”\\n— Ulloa’s South America\\nYou can count on there being a whole host of impinging forces\\nthat will aWect the dynamic of decision-making on any issue at\\na big company.\\nThe consensus building process, trade-oWs, quids pro quo, politics, rivalries, arguments, mentorships, revenge for past wrongs,\\nPart 5: The Moby Dick theory of big companies 35\\nturf-building, engineering groups, product managers, product\\nmarketers, sales, corporate marketing, Xnance, HR, legal, channels, business development, the strategy team, the international\\ndivisions, investors, Wall Street analysts, industry analysts, good\\npress, bad press, press articles being written that you don’t know\\nabout, customers, prospects, lost sales, prospects on the fence,\\npartners, this quarter’s sales numbers, this quarter’s margins, the\\nbond rating, the planning meeting that happened last week, the\\nplanning meeting that got cancelled this week, bonus programs,\\npeople joining the company, people leaving the company, people getting Xred by the company, people getting promoted, people getting sidelined, people getting demoted, who’s sleeping\\nwith whom, which dinner party the CEO went to last night,\\nthe guy who prepares the Powerpoint presentation for the staW\\nmeeting accidentally putting your startup’s name in too small a\\nfont to be read from the back of the conference room…\\nYou can’t possibly even identify all the factors that will come to\\nbear on a big company’s decision, much less try to understand\\nthem, much less try to inYuence them very much at all.\\n“The larger whales, whalers seldom venture to attack. They stand in\\nso great dread of some of them, that when out at sea they are afraid\\nto mention even their names, and carry dung, lime-stone, juniperwood, and some other articles of the same nature in their boats, in\\norder to terrify and prevent their too near approach.”\\n— Uno Von Troil’s Letters on Banks’s and Solander’s Voyage to Iceland In 1772\\nBack to Moby Dick.\\nMoby Dick might stalk you for three months, then jump out of\\nthe water and raise a huge ruckus, then vanish for six months,\\nthen come back and beach your whole boat, or alternately give\\nyou the clear shot you need to harpoon his giant butt.\\nAnd you’re never going to know why.\\nA big company might study you for three months, then\\napproach you and tell you they want to invest in you or partner\\nwith you or buy you, then vanish for six months, then come out\\n36 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nwith a directly competitive product that kills you, or alternately\\nacquire you and make you and your whole team rich.\\nAnd you’re never going to know why.\\nThe upside of dealing with a big company is that there’s potentially a ton of whale meat in it for you.\\nSorry, mixing my metaphors. The right deal with the right big\\ncompany can have a huge impact on a startup’s success.\\n“And what thing soever besides cometh within the chaos of this\\nmonster’s mouth, be it beast, boat, or stone, down it goes all incontinently that foul great swallow of his, and perisheth in the bottomless gulf of his paunch.”\\n— Holland’s Plutarch’s Morals\\nThe downside of dealing with a big company is that he can capsize you — maybe by stepping on you in one way or another\\nand killing you, but more likely by wrapping you up in a bad\\npartnership that ends up holding you back, or just making you\\nwaste a huge amount of time in meetings and get distracted\\nfrom your core mission.\\nSo what to do?\\nFirst, don’t do startups that require deals with big companies to\\nmake them successful.\\nThe risk of never getting those deals is way too high, no matter\\nhow hard you are willing to work at it.\\nAnd even if you get the deals, they probably won’t work out the\\nway you hoped.\\n“‘Stern all!’ exclaimed the mate, as upon turning his head, he saw\\nthe distended jaws of a large Sperm Whale close to the head of the\\nboat, threatening it with instant destruction; — ‘Stern all, for your\\nlives!\\'”\\n— Wharton the Whale Killer\\nSecond, never assume that a deal with a big company is closed\\nPart 5: The Moby Dick theory of big companies 37\\nuntil the ink hits the paper and/or the cash hits the company\\nbank account.\\nThere is always something that can cause a deal that looks like\\nit’s closed, to suddenly get blown to smithereens — or vanish\\nwithout a trace.\\nAt day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned\\nafresh.\\n“D’ye see him?” cried Ahab aaer allowing a little space for the light\\nto spread.\\n“See nothing, sir.”\\n— Moby Dick\\nThird, be extremely patient.\\nBig companies play “hurry up and wait” all the time.

Too much?\\nIn this post, I answer these questions:\\nHow much funding for a startup is too little?\\nHow much funding for a startup is too much?\\nAnd how can you know, and what can you do about it?\\nThe Xrst question to ask is, what is the correct, or appropriate,\\namount of funding for a startup?\\nThe answer to that question, in my view, is based my theory that\\na startup’s life can be divided into two parts — Before Product/\\nMarket Fit, and AMer Product/Market Fit.\\nBefore Product/Market Fit, a startup should ideally raise at\\nleast enough money to get to Product/Market Fit.\\nALer Product/Market Fit, a startup should ideally raise at least\\nenough money to fully exploit the opportunity in front of it,\\nand then to get to proXtability while still fully exploiting that\\nopportunity.\\nI will further argue that the deXnition of “at least enough\\nmoney” in each case should include a substantial amount of\\nextra money beyond your default plan, so that you can withstand bad surprises. In other words, insurance. This is partic-\\nularly true for startups that have not yet achieved Product/\\nMarket Fit, since you have no real idea how long that will take.\\nThese answers all sound obvious, but in my experience, a surprising number of startups go out to raise funding and do not\\nhave an underlying theory of how much money they are raising\\nand for precisely what purpose they are raising it.\\nWhat if you can’t raise that much money at\\nonce?\\nObviously, many startups Xnd that they cannot raise enough\\nmoney at one time to accomplish these objectives — but I\\nbelieve this is still the correct underlying theory for how much\\nmoney a startup should raise and around which you should orient your thinking.\\nIf you are Before Product/Market Fit and you can’t raise\\nenough money in one shot to get to Product/Market Fit, then\\nyou will need get as far as you can on each round and demonstrate progress towards Product/Market Fit when you raise each\\nnew round.\\nIf you are ALer Product/Market Fit and you can’t raise enough\\nmoney in one shot to fully exploit your opportunity, you have\\na high-class problem and will probably — but not deXnitely —\\nXnd that it gets continually easier to raise new money as you\\nneed it.\\nWhat if you don’t want to raise that much\\nmoney at once?\\nYou can argue you should raise a smaller amount of money at\\na time, because if you are making progress — either BPMF or\\nAPMF — you can raise the rest of the money you need later, at\\na higher valuation, and give away less of the company.\\nThis is the reason some entrepreneurs who can raise a lot of\\nmoney choose to hold back.\\n42 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nHere’s why you shouldn’t do that:\\nWhat are the consequences of not raising enough money?\\nNot raising enough money risks the survival of your company,\\nfor the following reasons:\\nFirst, you may have — and probably will have — unanticipated\\nsetbacks within your business.\\nMaybe a new product release slips, or you have unexpected\\nquality issues, or one of your major customers goes bankrupt, or\\na challenging new competitor emerges, or you get sued by a big\\ncompany for patent infringement, or you lose a key engineer.\\nSecond, the funding window may not be open when you need\\nmore money.\\nSometimes investors are highly enthusiastic about funding new\\nbusinesses, and sometimes they’re just not.\\nWhen they’re not — when the “window is shut”, as the saying\\ngoes — it is very hard to convince them otherwise, even though\\nthose are many of the best times to invest in startups because\\nof the prevailing atmosphere of fear and dread that is holding\\neveryone else back.\\nThose of us who were in startups that lived through 2001-2003\\nknow exactly what this can be like.\\nThird, something completely unanticipated, and bad, might\\nhappen.\\nAnother major terrorist attack is the one that I frankly worry\\nabout the most. A superbug. All-out war in the Middle East.\\nNorth Korea demonstrating the ability to launch a true nucleartipped ICBM. Giant Yaming meteorites. Such worst-case scenarios will not only close the funding window, they might keep\\nit closed for a long time.\\nFunny story: it turns out that a lot of Internet business models\\nfrom the late 90’s that looked silly at the time actually work\\nPart 6: How much funding is too little? Too much? 43\\nreally well — either in their original form or with some tweaking.\\nAnd there are quite a few startups from the late 90’s that are\\ndoing just great today — examples being OpenTable (which is\\nabout to go public) and TellMe (which recently sold itself to\\nMicrosoa for $800 million), and my own company Opsware\\n— which would be bankrupt today if we hadn’t raised a ton of\\nmoney when we could, and instead just did its Xrst $100 million\\nrevenue year and has a roughly $1 billion public market value.\\nI’ll go so far as to say that the big diWerence between the startups\\nfrom that era that are doing well today versus the ones that no\\nlonger exist, is that the former group raised a ton of money\\nwhen they could, and the latter did not.\\nSo how much money should I raise?\\nIn general, as much as you can. Without giving away control of\\nyour company, and without being insane.\\nEntrepreneurs who try to play it too aggressive and hold back\\non raising money when they can because they think they can\\nraise it later occasionally do very well, but are gambling their\\nwhole company on that strategy in addition to all the normal\\nstartup risks.\\nSuppose you raise a lot of money and you do really well. You’ll\\nbe really happy and make a lot of money, even if you don’t make\\nquite as much money as if you had rolled the dice and raised\\nless money up front.\\nSuppose you don’t raise a lot of money when you can and it\\nbackXres. You lose your company, and you’ll be really, really sad.\\nIs it really worth that risk?\\nThere is one additional consequence to raising a lot of money\\nthat you should bear in mind, although it is more important for\\nsome companies than others.\\n44 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nThat is liquidation preference. In the scenario where your\\ncompany ultimately gets acquired: the more money you raise\\nfrom outside investors, the higher the acquisition price has to be\\nfor the founders and employees to make money on top of the\\ninitial payout to the investors.\\nIn other words, raising a lot of money can make it much harder\\nto eWectively sell your company for less than a very high price,\\nwhich you may not be able to get when the time comes.\\nIf you are convinced that your company is going to get bought,\\nand you don’t think the purchase price will be that high, then\\nraising less money is a good idea purely in terms of optimizing\\nfor your own Xnancial outcome. However, that strategy has lots\\nof other risks and will be addressed in another entertaining post,\\nto be entitled “Why building to Yip is a bad idea”.\\nTaking these factors into account, though, in a normal scenario,\\nraising more money rather than less usually makes sense,\\nsince you are buying yourself insurance against both internal\\nand external potential bad events — and that is more important than worrying too much about dilution or liquidation preference.\\nHow much money is too much?\\nThere are downside consequences to raising too much money.\\nI already discussed two of them — possibly incremental dilution\\n(which I dismissed as a real concern in most situations), and possibly excessively high liquidation preference (which should be\\nmonitored but not obsessed over).\\nThe big downside consequence to too much money, though,\\nis cultural corrosion.\\nYou don’t have to be in this industry very long before you run\\ninto the startup that has raised a ton of money and has become\\ninfected with a culture of complacency, laziness, and arrogance.\\nRaising a ton of money feels really good — you feel like you’ve\\nPart 6: How much funding is too little? Too much? 45\\ndone something, that you’ve accomplished something, that\\nyou’re successful when a lot of other people weren’t.\\nAnd of course, none of those things are true.\\nRaising money is never an accomplishment in and of itself —\\nit just raises the stakes for all the hard work you would have had\\nto do anyway: actually building your business.\\nSome signs of cultural corrosion caused by raising too much\\nmoney:\\n• Hiring too many people — slows everything down and makes\\nit much harder for you to react and change. You are almost\\ncertainly setting yourself up for layoWs in the future, even if\\nyou are successful, because you probably won’t accurately\\nallocate the hiring among functions for what you will really\\nneed as your business grows.\\n• Lazy management culture — it is easy for a management\\nculture to get set where the manager’s job is simply to hire\\npeople, and then every other aspect of management suWers,\\nwith potentially disastrous long-term consequences to\\nmorale and eWectiveness.\\n• Engineering team bloat — another side eWect of hiring too\\nmany people; it’s very easy for engineering teams to get too\\nlarge, and it happens very fast. And then the “Mythical Man\\nMonth” eWect kicks in and everything slows to a crawl, your\\nbest people get frustrated and quit, and you’re in huge\\ntrouble.\\n• Lack of focus on product and customers — it’s a lot easier to\\nnot be completely obsessed with your product and your\\ncustomers when you have a lot of money in the bank and\\ndon’t have to worry about your doors closing imminently.\\n• Too many salespeople too soon — out selling a product that\\nisn’t quite ready yet, hasn’t yet achieved Product/Market Fit\\n— alienating early adopters and making it much harder to go\\nback when the product does get right.\\n• Product schedule slippage — what’s the urgency? We have all\\n46 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nthis cash! Creating a golden opportunity for a smaller,\\nscrappier startup to come along and kick your rear.\\nSo what should you do if you do raise a lot of money?\\nAs my old boss Jim Barksdale used to say, the main thing is to keep\\nthe main thing the main thing — be just as focused on product and\\ncustomers when you raise a lot of money as you would be if you\\nhadn’t raised a lot of money.\\nEasy to say, hard to do, but worth it.\\nContinue to run as lean as you can, bank as much of the money\\nas possible, and save it for a rainy day — or a nuclear winter.\\nTell everyone inside the company, over and over and over, until\\nthey can’t stand it anymore, and then tell them some more,\\nthat raising money does not count as an accomplishment and that you\\nhaven’t actually done anything yet other than raise the stakes\\nand increase the pressure.\\nIllustrate that point by staying as scrappy as possible on material\\nitems — oZce space, furniture, etc. The two areas to splurge,\\nin my opinion, are big-screen monitors and ergonomic oZce\\nchairs. Other than that, it should be Ikea all the way.\\nThe easiest way to lose control of your spending when you raise\\ntoo much money is to hire too many people. The second easiest\\nway is to pay people too much. Worry more about the Xrst one\\nthan the second one; more people multiply spending a lot faster\\nthan a few raises.\\nGenerally speaking, act like you haven’t raised nearly as much money\\nas you actually have — in how you talk, act, and spend.\\nIn particular, pay close attention to deadlines. The easiest thing to\\ngo wrong when you raise a lot of money is that suddenly things\\ndon’t seem so urgent anymore. Oh, they are. Competitors still\\nlurk behind every bush and every tree, metaphorically speaking.

You are simply probably not going to know\\nwhether your initial idea will work as a product and a business, or\\nnot. And you will probably have to rapidly evolve your plan —\\npossibly every aspect of it — as you go.\\n(The military has a saying that expresses the same concept —\\n“No battle plan ever survives contact with the enemy.” In this\\ncase, your enemy is the world at large.)\\nIt is therefore much more important for a startup to aggressively\\nseek out a big market, and product/market Ft within that market, once\\nthe startup is up and running, than it is to try to plan out what\\nyou are going to do in great detail ahead of time.\\nThe history of successful startups is quite clear on this topic.\\nNormally I would simply point to Microsoa, which started as\\na programming tools company before IBM all but forced Bill\\nGates to go into the operating system business, or Oracle, which\\nwas a consultancy for the CIA before Larry Ellison decided to\\nproductize the relational database, or Intel, which was a much\\nsmaller company focused on the memory chip market until the\\nJapanese onslaught of the mid-80’s forced Andy Grove to switch\\nfocus to CPUs.\\nHowever, I’ve recently been reading Randall Stross’s marvelous\\nbook about Thomas Edison, The Wizard of Menlo Park.\\nEdison’s Xrst commercially viable breakthrough invention was\\nthe phonograph — the forerunner to what you kids know as\\nthe record player, the turntable, the Walkman, the CD player,\\nand the IPod. Edison went on, of course, to become one of the\\ngreatest inventors and innovators of all time.\\nAs our story begins, Edison, an unknown inventor running his\\nown startup, is focused on developing better hardware for telegraph operators. He is particularly focused on equipment for\\ntelegraph operators to be able to send voice messages over telegraph lines.\\nCue the book:\\nThe day aaer Edison had noted the idea for recording voice messages received by a telegraphy oZce, he came up with a variation.\\nThat evening, on 18 July 1877, when [his lab’s] midnight dinner\\nhad been consumed… [Edison] turned around to face [his assistant\\nCharles Batchelor] and casually remarked, “Batch, if we had a point\\non this, we could make a record of some material which we could\\naaerwards pull under the point, and it would give us the speech\\nback.”\\nAs soon as Edison had pointed it out, it seemed so obvious that they\\ndid not pause to appreciate… the suggestion. Everyone jumped up\\nto rig a test… within an hour, they had the gizmo set up on the\\ntable… Edison sat down, leaned into the mouthpiece… [and] delivered the stock phrase the lab used to test telephone diaphragms:\\n“Mary had a little lamb.”\\n…Batchelor reinserted the beginning of the [strip on which the\\nphrase had been recorded]… out came “ary ad ell am.” “It was not\\nXne talking,” Batchelor recalled, “but the shape of it was there.”\\nThe men celebrated with a whoop, shook hands with one another,\\nand worked on. By breakfast the following morning, they had\\nsucceeded in getting clear articulation from waxed paper, the Xrst\\nrecording medium — in the Xrst midnight recording session.\\n50 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\n…The discovery was treated suprisingly casually in the lab’s notebooks…\\nIt was a singular moment in the modern history of invention, but,\\nin the years that would follow, Edison would never tell the story the\\nway it actually unfolded that summer, always moving the events\\nfrom July 1877 to December. We may guess the reason why: in July,\\nhe and his assistants failed to appreciate what they had discovered.\\nAt the time, they were working feverishly to develop a set of working telephones to show their best prospect… Western Union… There\\nwas no time to pause and reYect on the incidental invention of what\\nwas the Xrst working model of the phonograph…\\nThe invention continued to be labeled in the notebooks with the\\nbroader rubric “speaking telegraph”, reYecting the assumption that\\nit would be put to use in the telegraph oZce, recording messages.\\nAn unidentiXed staW member draw up a list of possible names\\nfor the machine, which included: tel-autograph, tel-autophone,\\n“chronophone = time-announcer = speaking clock”, “didaskophone\\n= teaching speaker = portable teacher”, “glottophone = language\\nsounder or speaker”, “climatophone = weather announcer”, “klangophone = bird cry sounder”, “hulagmophone = barking sounder”…\\n…In October 1877, [Edison] wrote his father that he was “at present\\nvery hard up for cash,” but if his “speaking telegraph” was successful, he would receive an advance on royalties. The commercial\\npotential of his still-unnamed recording apparatus remained out of\\nsight…\\n[A description of the phonograph in ScientiXc American in early\\nNovember] set oW a frenzy in America and Europe. The New York\\nSun was fascinated by the metaphysical implications of an invention that could play “echoes from dead voices”.

This is a topic that could Xll a\\nwhole book, but in this post I will provide speciXc guidelines on\\nhow to hire, manage, promote, and Xre executives in a startup\\nbased on my personal observations and experiences.\\nFor the purposes of this post, deXnitions: An executive is\\na leader — someone who runs a function within the company\\nand has primary responsibility for an organization within the\\ncompany that will contribute to the company’s success or failure. The diWerence between an executive and a manager is that\\nthe executive has a higher degree of latitude to organize, make\\ndecisions, and execute within her function than a manager. The\\nmanager may ask what the right thing to do is; the executive should\\nknow.\\nThe general theory of executives, like managers, is, per Andy\\nGrove: the output of an executive is the output of her organization.\\nTherefore, the primary task of an executive is to maximize the\\noutput of her organization. However, in a startup, a successful\\nexecutive must accomplish three other critical tasks simultaneously:\\n• Build her organization– typically when an executive arrives\\nor is promoted into her role at a startup, she isn’t there to be\\na caretaker; rather she must build her organization, oaen\\nfrom scratch. This is a sharp diWerence from many big\\ncompany executives, who can spend their entire careers\\nrunning organizations other people built — oaen years or\\ndecades earlier.\\n• Be a primary individual contributor– a startup executive\\nmust “roll up her sleeves” and produce output herself. There\\nare no shortage of critical things to be done at a startup, and\\nan executive who cannot personally produce while\\nsimultaneously building and running her organization\\ntypically will not last long. Again, this is a sharp diWerence\\nfrom many big companies, where executives oaen serve\\nmore as administrators and bureaucrats.\\n• Be a team player– a startup executive must take personal\\nresponsibility for her relationships with her peers and people\\nthroughout the startup, in all functions and at all levels. Big\\ncompanies can oaen tolerate internal rivalries and warfare;\\nstartups cannot.\\nBeing a startup executive is not an easy job. The rewards are\\nsubstantial — the ability to contribute directly to the startups’s\\nsuccess; the latitude to build and run an organization according\\nto her own theories and principles; and a meaningful equity\\nstake that can lead to personal Xnancial independence if the\\nstartup succeeds — but the responsibilities are demanding and\\nintense.\\nHiring\\nFirst, if you’re not sure whether you need an executive for a function,\\ndon’t hire one.\\nStartups, particularly well-funded startups, oaen hire executives\\ntoo early. Particularly before a startup has achieved product/\\nmarket Xt, it is oMen better to have a highly motivated manager or\\ndirector running a function than an executive.\\nHiring an executive too quickly can lead to someone who is\\nreally expensive, sitting there in the middle of the room, doing\\nvery little. Not good for the executive, not good for the rest of\\nPart 8: Hiring, managing, promoting, and Dring executives 55\\nthe team, not good for the burn rate, and not good for the company.\\nHire an executive only when it’s clear that you need one: when an\\norganization needs to get built; when hiring needs to accelerate;\\nwhen you need more processes and structure and rigor to how\\nyou do things.\\nSecond, hire the best person for the next nine months, not the next\\nthree years.\\nI’ve seen a lot of startups overshoot on their executive hires.\\nThey need someone to build the soaware development team\\nfrom four people to 30 people over the next nine months, so\\nthey hire an executive from a big company who has been running 400 people. That is usually death.\\nHire for what you need now — and for roughly the next nine\\nmonths. At the very least, you will get what you need now, and\\nthe person you hire may well be able to scale and keep going for\\nyears to come.\\nIn contrast, if you overhire — if you hear yourself saying, “this\\nperson will be great when we get bigger” — you are most likely\\nhiring someone who, best case, isn’t that interested in doing\\nthings at the scale you need, and worst case, doesn’t know how.\\nThird, whenever possible, promote from within.\\nGreat companies develop their own executives. There are several reasons for this:\\n• You get to develop your best people and turn them into\\nexecutives, which is great for both them and you — this is the\\nsingle best, and usually the only, way to hold onto great\\npeople for long periods of time.\\n• You ensure that your executives completely know and\\nunderstand your company culture, strategy, and ethics.\\n• Your existing people are the “devil you know” — anyone new\\ncoming from outside is going to have Yaws, oaen really\\nserious ones, but you probably won’t Xgure out what they are\\n56 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nuntil aaer you’ve hired them. With your existing people, you\\nknow, and you minimize your odds of being shocked and\\nappalled.\\nOf course, this isn’t always possible. Which segues us directly\\ninto…\\nFourth, my list of the key things to look at, and for, when evaluating executive candidates:\\n• Look for someone who is hungry and driven– someone who\\nwants a shot at doing “their thing”. Someone who has been an\\nup and comer at a midsized company but wants a shot at\\nbeing a primary executive at a startup can be a great catch.\\n• Flip side of that: beware people who have “done it\\nbefore”.Sometimes you do run into someone who has been VP\\nEngineering at four companies and loves it and wants to do it\\nat a Xah company. More oaen, you will be dealing with\\nsomeone who is no longer hungry and driven. This is a very,\\nvery big problem to end up with — be very careful.\\n• Don’t disqualify someone based on ego or cockiness– as long as\\nshe’s not insane. Great executives are high-ego — you want\\nsomeone driven to run things, driven to make decisions,\\nconXdent in herself and her abilities. I don’t mean loud and\\nobnoxious, I mean assured and determined, bleeding over\\ninto cocky. If a VC’s ideal investment is a company that will\\nsuccceed without him, then your ideal executive hire is someone who\\nwill succeed without you.\\n• Beware hiring a big company executive for a startup.The\\nexecutive skill sets required for a big company vs a startup\\nare very Even great big company executives frequently\\nhave no idea what to do once they arrive at a startup.\\n• In particular, really beware hiring an executive from an incredibly\\nsuccessful big company. This is oaen very tempting — who\\nwouldn’t want to bring onboard someone who sprinkles\\nsome of that IBM (in the 80’s), Microsoa (in the 90’s), or\\nGoogle (today) fairy dust on your startup? The issue is that\\npeople who have been at an incredibly successful big\\ncompany oaen cannot function in a normal, real world,\\nPart 8: Hiring, managing, promoting, and Dring executives 57\\ncompetitive situation where they don’t start every day with\\n80% market share. Back in the 80’s, you oaen heard, “never\\nhire anyone straight out of IBM — Xrst, let them go\\nsomewhere else and fail, and then hire them”. Believe it.\\n• This probably goes without saying, but look for a pattern of\\noutput– accomplishment. Validate it by reference checking\\npeers, reports, and bosses. Along the way, reference check\\npersonality and teamwork, but look Xrst and foremost for a\\npattern of output.\\nFiah, by all means, use an executive recruiter, but for sourcing, not\\nevaluation.\\nThere are some executive recruiters who are actually really\\ngood at evaluation. Others are not. It’s beside the point. It’s your\\njob to evaluate and make the decision, not the recruiter’s.\\nI say this because I have never met a recruiter who lacks conXdence in his ability to evaluate candidates and pass judgment on\\nwho’s right for a given situation. This can lull a startup founder\\ninto relying on the recruiter’s judgment instead of really digging\\nin and making your own decision. Betting that your recruiter is\\ngreat at evaluation is not a risk you want to take. You’re the one\\nwho has to Xre the executive if it doesn’t work out.\\nSixth, be ready to pay market compensation, including more cash\\ncompensation than you want, but watch for red Gags in the compensation discussion.\\nYou want someone focused on upside — on building a company. That means, a focus on their stock option package Xrst\\nand foremost.\\nWatch out for candidates who want egregious amounts of cash,\\nhigh bonuses, restricted stock, vacation days, perks, or — worst\\nof all — guaranteed severance. A candiate who is focused on\\nthose things, as opposed to the option package, is not ready to\\ndo a startup.\\nOn a related note, be careful about option accceleration in the\\nevent of change of control. This is oaen reasonable for support\\n58 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nfunctions such as Xnance, legal, and HR where an acquirer\\nwould most likely not have a job for the startup executive in\\nany of those functions. But this is not reasonable, in my view,\\nfor core functions such as engineering, product management,\\nmarketing, or sales. You don’t want your key executives focused\\non selling the company — unless of course you want them\\nfocused on selling the company. Make your acceleration decisions accordingly.\\nSeventh, when hiring the executive to run your former specialty, be\\ncareful you don’t hire someone weak on purpose.\\nThis sounds silly, but you wouldn’t believe how oaen it happens.\\nThe CEO who used to be a product manager who has a weak\\nproduct management executive. The CEO who used to be in\\nsales who has a weak sales executive. The CEO who used to be\\nin marketing who has a weak marketing executive.\\nI call this the “Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem” — aaer the CEO of Disney who had previously been a brilliant TV network executive. When he bought ABC at Disney, it\\npromptly fell to fourth place. His response? “If I had an extra\\ntwo days a week, I could turn around ABC myself.” Well, guess\\nwhat, he didn’t have an extra two days a week.\\nA CEO — or a startup founder — oaen has a hard time letting\\ngo of the function that brought him to the party. The result: you\\nhire someone weak into the executive role for that function so\\nthat you can continue to be “the man” — consciously or subconsciously. Don’t let it happen to you — make sure the person you\\nhire into that role is way better than you used to be.\\nEighth, recognize that hiring an executive is a high-risk proposition.\\nYou oaen see a startup with a screwed up development process,\\nbut “when we get our VP of Engineering onboard, everything\\nwill get Xxed”. Or a startup that is missing its revenue targets, but\\n“when we get our VP of sales, reveue will take oW”.\\nHere’s the problem: in my experience, if you know what you’re\\ndoing, the odds of a given executive hire working out will be about\\nPart 8: Hiring, managing, promoting, and Dring executives 59\\n50/50. That is, about 50% of the time you’ll screw up and ultimately have to replace the person. (If you don’t know what\\nyou’re doing, your failure rate will be closer to 100%.)\\nWhy? People are people. People are complicated. People have\\nYaws. You oaen don’t know what those Yaws are until aaer you\\nget to know them. Those Yaws are oaen fatal in an executive\\nrole. And more generally, sometimes the Xt just isn’t there.\\nThis is why I’m so gung ho on promoting from within. At least\\nthen you know what the Yaws are up front.\\nManaging\\nFirst, manage your executives.\\nIt’s not that uncommon to see startup founders, especially Xrsttimers, who hire executives and are then reluctant to manage\\nthem.\\nYou can see the thought process: I just hired this really great, really\\nexperienced VP of Engineering who has way more experience running\\ndevelopment teams than I ever did — I should just let him go do his\\nthing!\\nThat’s a bad idea. While respecting someone’s experience and\\nskills, you should nevertheless manage every executive as if she\\nwere a normal employee. This means weekly 1:1’s, performance\\nreviews, written objectives, career development plans, the whole\\nnine yards. Skimp on this and it is very easy for both your relationship with her and her eWectiveness in the company to skew\\nsideways.\\nThis even holds if you’re 22 and she’s 40, or 50, or 60! Don’t be\\nshy, that will just scare her — and justiXably so.\\nSecond, give your executives the latitude to run their organizations.\\nThis is the balancing act with the previous point, but it’s equally\\nimportant. Don’t micromanage.\\nThe whole point of having an executive is to have someone who\\n60 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\ncan Xgure out how to build and run an organization so that you\\ndon’t have to. Manage her, understand what she is doing, be\\nvery clear on the results you expect, but let her do the job.\\nHere’s the key corollary to that: if you want to give an executive full\\nlatitude, but you’re reluctant to do so because you’re not sure she can\\nmake it happen, then it’s probably time to Fre her.\\nIn my experience it’s not that uncommon for a founder or CEO\\nto be uncomfortable — sometimes only at a gut level — at really\\ngiving an executive the latitude to run with the ball. That is a\\nsureXre signal that the executive is not working out and probably needs to be Xred. More on that below.\\nThird, ruthlessly violate the chain of command in order to gather data.\\nI don’t mean going around telling people under an executive\\nwhat to do without her knowing about it. I mean, ask questions,\\ncontinually, at all levels of the organization. How are things\\ngoing? What do you think of the new hires? How oaen are you\\nmeeting with your manager? And so on.\\nYou never want the bulk of your information about a function\\ncoming from the executive running that function. That’s the\\nbest way to be completely and utterly surprised when everything blows up.\\nHere’s the kicker: a great executive never minds when the CEO talks\\nto people in her organization. In fact, she loves it, because it means\\nthe CEO just hears more great things about her.\\nIf you have an executive who doesn’t want you to talk to people\\nin her organization, you have a bad executive.\\nPromoting\\nThis will be controversial, but I am a big fan of promoting talented\\npeople as fast as you can — promoting up and comers into executive roles, and promoting executives into bigger and broader\\nresponsibilities.\\nPart 8: Hiring, managing, promoting, and Dring executives 61\\nYou can clearly overdo this — you can promote someone before\\nthey are ready and in the worst case, completely screw up their\\ncareer. (Seen it. Done it.) You can also promote someone to their\\nlevel of incompetence — the Peter Principle. (Seen it. Done it.)\\nHowever, life is short, startups move fast, and you have stuE to get\\ndone. You aren’t going to have the privilege of working with\\nthat many great, talented, high-potential people in your career.\\nWhen you Xnd one, promote her as fast as you can. Great for\\nher, great for the company, and great for you.\\nThis assumes you are properly training and managing her along the\\nway. That is lea as an exercise for the reader.\\nThe surest sign someone is ready for promotion is when they’re doing\\na great job running their current team. Projects are getting done,\\nteam morale is good, new hires are top quality, people are\\nhappy. Time to promote some people into new challenges.\\nI’m a Xrm believer that most people who do great things are doing\\nthem for the Frst time. Returning to my theory of hiring, I’d rather\\nhave someone all Xred up to do something for the Xrst time\\nthan someone who’s done it before and isn’t that excited to do it\\nagain. You rarely go wrong giving someone who is high potential the shot.\\nThis assumes you can tell the high potential people apart from everyone\\nelse. That too is lea as an exercise for the reader.\\nFiring\\nFirst, recognize the paradox of deciding to Fre an executive.\\nThe paradox works like this:\\nIt takes time to gather data to evaluate an executive’s performance. You can’t evaluate an executive based on her own output, like a normal employee — you have to evaluate her based\\non the output of her organization. It takes time for her to build\\nand manage her organization to generate output. Therefore, it\\n62 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\ntakes longer to evaluate the performance of an executive than a normal\\nemployee.\\nBut, an executive can cause far more damage than a normal\\nemployee. A normal employee doesn’t work out, Xne, replace\\nhim. An executive doesn’t work out, it can — worst case — permanently cripple her function and sometimes the entire company. Therefore, it is far more important to Fre a bad executive as fast\\nas possible, versus a normal employee.\\nSolution? There isn’t one. It’s a permanent problem.\\nI once asked Andy Grove, one of the world’s all-time best CEOs,\\nabout this. He said, you always Xre a bad executive too late. If\\nyou’re really good, you’ll Xre her about three months too late.\\nBut you’ll always do it too late. If you did it fast enough that it\\nwasn’t too late, you wouldn’t have enough data, and you’d risk\\nbeing viewed as arbitrary and capricious by the rest of the organization.\\nSecond, the minute you have a bad feeling in your gut, start gathering\\ndata.\\nBack to the point on ruthlessly violating the chain of command\\n— get to it. Talk to everyone. Know what’s going on. Unless\\nyou’re paranoid — and, shockingly, I have met paranoid\\nfounders and CEOs, and not counting Andy Grove — you need\\nto gather the data because you’re going to need to Xre the executive — if you’re good, in about three months.\\nIn the meantime, of course do everything you can to coach and\\ndevelop and improve the executive. If it works out, that’s great.\\nIf not, get ready.\\nA few speciXc things I think are critical to look for:\\n• Is the executive hiring?If there are open headcount slots and\\nnobody’s coming in the door, you have a problem. Just as bad\\nis when the new hires aren’t very good — when they’re\\nbringing down the average quality of the organization.\\n• Is the executive training and developing her people?Oaen in a\\nPart 8: Hiring, managing, promoting, and Dring executives 63\\nstartup, an executive is hired to take over a function that’s\\nalready been started, at least in rudimentary form. The\\npeople in that function should be noticeably better at their\\njobs, and highly respectful of the executive’s skills, within the\\nXrst several months at the very least. If not, you have a\\nproblem.\\n• What do the other executives think?Great executives are oaen\\nimperfect but their peers always respect them. If your other\\nexecutives are skeptical of a new executive aaer the Xrst few\\nmonths, you have a problem.\\n• Is it painful for you to interact with the executive?Do you try to\\navoid or cancel your 1:1’s? Does talking to her give you a\\nheadache? Do you oaen not understand what point she’s\\ntrying to make or why she’s focused on such an odd issue? If\\nthe answer to any of these questions is yes, you have a\\nproblem.\\nThird, Fre crisply.\\nFiring an executive sucks. It’s disruptive to the organization. It\\ncreates a lot of work for you — not least of which is you’ll have\\nto go Xnd someone else for the job. And, it risks making you\\nlook bad, since you’re the one who hired the person in the Xrst\\nplace.\\nAnd it always seems to happen at a critical time in your startup’s\\nlife, when the last thing you need is a distraction like this.\\nNevertheless, the only thing to do is do it, do it professionally,\\nmake clear to the organization what will happen next, and get\\non down the road.\\nIn my opinion the two most common mistakes people make\\nwhen they Xre executives both fall in the category of pulling\\none’s punches, and I highly recommend avoiding them:\\n• Long transition periods — tempting, but counterproductive.\\nConfusing, demoralizing, and just plain weird. Instead, make\\na clean break, put a new person in charge — even if only on\\nan acting basis — and get moving.\\n64 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\n• Demotion as an alternative to Xring (or, alternately, “I know,\\nwe’ll hire her a boss!”). Hate it. Great people don’t deal well\\nwith getting demoted. There is an occasional exception.\\nUnless you are positive you have such an exception, skip it,\\nand move directly to the conclusion.\\nFourth, don’t feel guilty.\\nYou’re not beheading anyone.\\nAnyone who got a job as an executive at a startup is going to\\nhave an easy time getting the next job. Aaer all, she can always\\npaint you as a crazy founder, or inept CEO.\\nMore oaen than not, when you Xre an executive, you are doing\\nher a favor — you are giving her a chance to Xnd a better Xt\\nin a diWerent company where she will be more valued, more\\nrespected, and more successful. This sounds mushy, but I mean\\nit. And if she can’t, then she has a much deeper problem and\\nyou just dodged a huge bullet.\\nAnd on that cheery note, good luck!\\nCounterpoint: Ben Horowitz on\\nmicromanagement\\n[This is a guest post from my business partner Ben Horowitz, reacting\\nto my recent post about hiring, managing, promoting, and Fring executives. I have italicized the parts where he really tears into me for your\\nadded humor value.]\\nWhile I enjoyed Marc’s post on hiring and Xring executives, I\\nthink that he unfairly dissed micromanagement.\\nHere’s why.\\nEveryone knows that the hyper-controlling manager with the\\nsevere personality disorder who micromanages every crummy\\ndecision is no fun to work for. However, it is wrong to condemn\\nthe practice of micromanagement on that basis.\\nPart 8: Hiring, managing, promoting, and Dring executives 65\\nSpeciXcally, there are times and situations where micromanaging executives is not just ok, but also the right thing to do.\\nAndy Grove has an excellent explanation of this in his classic\\nbook High Output Management, where he describes a concept\\ncalled “Task Relevant Maturity”. Andy explains that employees\\nwho are immature in a given task require detailed training and\\ninstruction. They need to be micromanaged. On the other\\nhand, if an employee is relatively mature in a task, then it is\\ncounterproductive and annoying to manage the details of their\\nwork.\\nThis is also true when managing executives. Marc might think\\nthat he hires an executive because she has the experience and\\nknow-how to comprehensively do her job, so any detailed\\ninstruction would be unwise and unwarranted. Marc would be\\nwrong about that. It turns out that even — and maybe especially\\n— executives are also immature in certain tasks.\\nIt is almost always the case that a new executive will be immature in their understanding of your market, your technology,\\nand your company — its personnel, processes, and culture. Will\\nthe new head of engineering at Ning walk in the door with\\nMarc’s understanding of the development process or the technology base? Would it be better for this new head of engineering\\nto make guesses and use her own best — not so good– judgment, or for Marc to review the Xrst say 20 decisions until the\\nnew exec is fully up to speed?\\nIn reality — as opposed to Marc’s warped view of reality — it will\\nbe extremely helpful for Marc [if he were actually the CEO,\\nwhich he is not] to meet with the new head of engineering daily\\nwhen she comes on board and review all of her thinking and\\ndecisions. This level of micromanagement will accelerate her\\ntraining and improve her long-term eWectiveness. It will make\\nher seem smarter to the rest of the organization which will build\\ncredibility and conXdence while she comes up to speed. Micromanaging new executives is generally a good idea for a limited\\nperiod of time.\\nHowever, that is not the only time that it makes sense to micro66 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nmanage executives. It turns out that just about every executive\\nin the world has a few things that are seriously wrong with\\nthem. They have areas where they are truly deXcient in judgment or skill set. That’s just life. Almost nobody is brilliant\\nat everything. When hiring and when Hring executives, you\\nmust therefore focus on strength rather than lack of weakness. Everybody has severe weaknesses even if you can’t see\\nthem yet. When managing, it’s oaen useful to micromanage and\\nto provide remedial training around these weaknesses. Doing so\\nmay make the diWerence between an executive succeeding or\\nfailing.\\nFor example, you might have a brilliant engineering executive\\nwho generates excellent team loyalty, has terriXc product judgment and makes the trains run on time. This same executive\\nmay be very poor at relating to the other functions in the company. She may generate far more than her share of cross-functional conYicts, cut herself oW from critical information, and\\nsigniXcantly impede your ability to sell and market eWectively.\\nYour alternatives are:\\n(a) Macro-manage and give her an annual or quarterly objective\\nto Xx it, or…\\n(b) Intensively micromanage her interactions until she learns\\nthe fundamental interpersonal skills required to be an eWective\\nexecutive.\\nI am arguing that doing (a) will likely result in weak performance. The reason is that she very likely has no idea how to be\\neWective with her peers. If somebody is an executive, it’s very\\nlikely that somewhere along the line somebody gave her feedback — perhaps abstractly — about all of her weaknesses. Yet\\nthe weakness remains. As a result, executives generally require\\nmore hands-on management than lower level employees to\\nimprove weak areas.\\nSo, micromanagement is like Xne wine. A little at the right times\\nwill really enhance things; too much all the time and you’ll end\\nup in rehab.\\nPart 8: Hiring, managing, promoting, and Dring executives 67\\nPart 9: How to hire a professional\\nCEO\\nDon’t.\\nIf you don’t have anyone on your founding team who is capable\\nof being CEO, then sell your company — now.\\nHow to hire the best people you\\'ve\\never worked with\\nThere are many aspects to hiring great people, and various people smarter than me have written extensively on the topic.\\nSo I’m not going to try to be comprehensive.\\nBut I am going to relay some lessons learned through hard\\nexperience on how to hire the best people you’ve ever worked\\nwith — particularly for a startup.\\nI’m going to cover two key areas in this post:\\n• Criteria: what to value when evaluating candidates.\\n• And process: how to actually run the hiring process, and if\\nnecessary the aaermath of making a mistake.\\nCriteria 7rst\\nLots of people will tell you to hire for intelligence.\\nEspecially in this industry.\\nYou will read, hire the smartest people out there and your company’s success is all but guaranteed.\\nI think intelligence, per se, is highly overrated.\\nSpeciXcally, I am unaware of any actual data that shows a cor-\\nrelation between raw intelligence, as measured by any of the\\nstandard metrics (educational achievement, intelligence tests, or\\nskill at solving logic puzzles) and company success.\\nNow, clearly you don’t want to hire dumb people, and clearly\\nyou’d like to work with smart people.\\nBut let’s get speciXc.\\nMost of the lore in our industry about the role of intelligence\\nin company success comes from two stratospherically successful companies — Microsoa, and now Google — that are famous\\nfor hiring for intelligence.\\nMicrosoa’s metric for intelligence was the ability to solve logic\\npuzzles.\\n(I don’t know if the new, MBA-heavy Microsoa still does this,\\nbut I do know this is how Microsoa in its heyday worked.)\\nFor example, a classic Microsoa interview question was: “Why\\nis a manhole cover round?”\\nThe right answer, of course, is, “Who cares? Are we in the manhole business?”\\n(Followed by twisting in your chair to look all around, getting\\nup, and leaving.)\\nGoogle, on the other hand, uses the metric of educational\\nachievement.\\nHave a PhD? Front of the line. Masters? Next. Bachelor’s? Go to\\nthe end.\\nIn apparent direct contraction to decades of experience in the\\ncomputer industry that PhD’s are the hardest people to motivate to ship commercially viable products — with rare exception.

Hi, Diego!)\\nNow, on the one hand, you can’t question the level of success of\\neither company.\\n70 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nMaybe they’re right.\\nBut maybe, just maybe, their success had a lot to do with other\\nfactors — say, huge markets, extreme aggressiveness, right time/\\nright place, key distribution deals, and at least in one case, great\\nproducts.\\nBecause here’s the problem: I’m not aware of another Microsoa\\nthat’s been built by hiring based on logic puzzles. And I’m not\\naware of another Google that’s been built by hiring PhD’s.\\nSo maybe there are other hiring criteria that are equally, or\\nmore, important.\\nHere’s what I think those criteria are.\\nDrive\\nI deXne drive as self-motivation — people who will walk right\\nthrough brick walls, on their own power, without having to be\\nasked, to achieve whatever goal is in front of them.\\nPeople with drive push and push and push and push and push\\nuntil they succeed.\\nWinston Churchill aaer the evacuation of Dunkirk:\\n“We shall not Yag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall\\nXght in France, we shall Xght on the seas and oceans, we shall\\nXght with growing conXdence and growing strength in the air,\\nwe shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall\\nXght on the beaches, we shall Xght on the landing grounds, we\\nshall Xght in the Xelds and in the streets, we shall Xght in the\\nhills; we shall never surrender.”\\nThat’s what you want.\\nSome people have it and some people don’t.\\nOf the people who have it, with some of them it comes from\\nguilt, oaen created by family pressure.\\nHow to hire the best people you\\'ve ever worked with 71\\nWith others, it comes from a burning desire to make it big.\\nWith others, it comes from being incredibly Type A.\\nWhatever… go with it.\\nDrive is independent of educational experience, grade point\\naverages, and socioeconomic background.\\n(But Marc, isn’t a 4.0 GPA a sure sign of drive? Well, it’s a sign\\nthat the person is driven to succeed on predeXned tests with\\nclear criteria and a grader — in an environment where the student’s parents are oaen paying a lot of money for the privilege\\nof having their child take the tests. That may or may not be the\\nsame thing as being driven to succeed in the real world.)\\nDrive is even independent of prior career success.\\nDriven people don’t tend to stay long at places where they can’t\\nsucceed, and just because they haven’t succeeded in the wrong\\ncompanies doesn’t mean they won’t succeed at your company\\n— if they’re driven.\\nI think you can see drive in a candidate’s eyes, and in a candidate’s background.\\nFor the background part, I like to see what someone has done.\\nNot been involved in, or been part of, or watched happen, or\\nwas hanging around when it happened.\\nI look for something you’ve done, either in a job or (oaen better\\nyet) outside of a job.\\nThe business you started and ran in high school.\\nThe nonproXt you started and ran in college.\\nIf you’re a programmer: the open source project to which\\nyou’ve made major contributions.\\nSomething.\\nIf you can’t Xnd anything — if a candidate has just followed the\\n72 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nrules their whole lives, showed up for the right classes and the\\nright tests and the right career opportunities without achieving\\nsomething distinct and notable, relative to their starting point —\\nthen they probably aren’t driven.\\nAnd you’re not going to change them.\\nMotivating people who are fundamentally unmotivated is not\\neasy.\\nBut motivating people who are self-motivated is wind at your\\nback.\\nI like speciXcally looking for someone for which this job is their\\nbig chance to really succeed.\\nFor this reason, I like hiring people who haven’t done the speciXc job before, but are determined to ace it regardless.\\nI also like speciXcally looking for someone who comes from\\nsome kind of challenging background — a diZcult family situation, say, or someone who had to work his/her way through\\nschool — who is nevertheless on par with his/her more fortunate peers in skills and knowledge.\\nFinally, beware in particular people who have been at highly\\nsuccessful companies.\\nPeople used to say, back when IBM owned the industry: never\\nhire someone straight out of IBM. First, let them go somewhere\\nelse and fail. Then, once they’ve realized the real world is not\\nlike IBM, hire them and they’ll be great.\\nAnd remember, an awful lot of people who have been at hugely\\nsuccessful companies were just along for the ride.\\nCareer success is great to look for — but it’s critical to verify that\\nthe candidates out of hugely successful companies actually did\\nwhat they claim in their roles at those companies. And that they\\nreally get it, that the real world is a lot tougher than being IBM\\nin the 80’s, or Microsoa in the 90’s, or Google today.\\nHow to hire the best people you\\'ve ever worked with 73\\nCuriosity\\nCuriosity is a proxy for, do you love what you do?\\nAnyone who loves what they do is inherently intensely curious\\nabout their Xeld, their profession, their craa.\\nThey read about it, study it, talk to other people about it…\\nimmerse themselves in it, continuously.\\nAnd work like hell to stay current in it.\\nNot because they have to.\\nBut because they love to.\\nAnyone who isn’t curious doesn’t love what they do.\\nAnd you should be hiring people who love what they do.\\nAs an example, programmers.\\nSit a programmer candidate for an Internet company down and\\nask them about the ten most interesting things happening in\\nInternet soaware.\\nREST vs SOAP, the new Facebook API, whether Ruby on Rails\\nis scalable, what do you think of Sun’s new Java-based scripting\\nlanguage, Google’s widgets API, Amazon S3, etc.\\nIf the candidate loves their Xeld, they’ll have informed opinions\\non many of these topics.\\nThat’s what you want.\\nNow, you might say, Marc, that’s great for a young kid who has a\\nlot of spare time to stay current, but what about the guy who has\\na family and only has time for a day job and can’t spend nights\\nand weekends reading blogs and staying that current?\\nWell, when you run into a person like that who isn’t current in\\ntheir Xeld, the other implication is that their day job isn’t keeping them current.\\n74 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nIf they’ve been in that job for a while, then ask yourself, is the\\nkind of person you’re looking for really going to have tolerated\\nstaying in a day job where their skills and knowledge get stale,\\nfor very long?\\nReally?\\nRemember — because of the Internet, staying current in any\\nXeld no longer costs any money.\\nIn my experience, drive and curiosity seem to coincide pretty\\nfrequently.\\nThe easiest way to be driven is to be in a Xeld that you love, and\\nyou’ll automatically be curious.\\nEthics\\nEthics are hard to test for.\\nBut watch for any whiW of less than stellar ethics in any candidate’s background or references.\\nAnd avoid, avoid, avoid.\\nUnethical people are unethical by nature, and the odds of a\\nmetaphorical jailhouse conversion are quite low.\\nPriests, rabbis, and ministers should give people a second\\nchance on ethics — not hiring managers at startups.\\n‘NuW said.\\nOne way to test for an aspect of ethics — honesty — is to test for\\nhow someone reacts when they don’t know something.\\nPick a topic you know intimately and ask the candidate increasingly esoteric questions until they don’t know the answer.\\nThey’ll either say they don’t know, or they’ll try to bullshit you.\\nGuess what. If they bullshit you during the hiring process,\\nthey’ll bullshit you once they’re onboard.\\nHow to hire the best people you\\'ve ever worked with 75\\nA candidate who is conXdent in his own capabilities and ethical\\n— the kind you want — will say “I don’t know” because they\\nknow that the rest of the interview will demonstrate their\\nknowledge, and they know that you won’t react well to being\\nbullshitted — because they wouldn’t react well either.\\nHow to run the hiring process\\nFirst, have a written hiring process.\\nWhatever your hiring process is — write it down, and make sure\\neveryone has a copy of it, on paper.\\nIt’s continually shocking how many startups have a random hiring process, and as a result hire apparently randomly.\\nSecond, do basic skills tests.\\nIt’s amazing how many people come in and interview for jobs\\nwhere their resume says they’re qualiXed, but ask them basic\\nquestions about how to do things in their domain, and they Yail.\\nFor example, test programmers on basic algorithms — linked\\nlists, binary searches.\\nJust in pseudocode — it doesn’t matter if they know the relevant\\nJava library calls.\\nIt does matter if they are unable to go up to the whiteboard and\\nwork their way through something that was covered in their Xrst\\nalgorithms course.\\nA lot of people come in and interview for programming jobs\\nwho, at their core, can’t program.\\nAnd it’s such a breath of fresh air when you get someone who\\njust goes, oh yeah, a linked list, sure, let me show you.\\nThe same principle applies to other Xelds.\\nFor a sales rep — have them sell you on your product all the way\\nto a closed deal.\\n76 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nFor a marketing person — have them whiteboard out a launch\\nfor your new product.\\nThird, plan out and write down interview questions ahead of\\ntime.\\nI’m assuming that you know the right interview questions for\\nthe role — and frankly, if you don’t, you probably shouldn’t be\\nthe hiring manager for that position.\\nThe problem I’m addressing is: most people don’t know how to\\ninterview a candidate.\\nAnd even people who do know how, aren’t necessarily good at\\ncoming up with questions on the Yy.\\nSo just make sure you have questions planned out and assigned\\nto each interviewer ahead of time.\\nI do this myself — always enter the room with a list of questions\\npre-planned — because I don’t want to count on coming up with\\nthem on the Yy.\\nThe best part is that you can then iteratively reXne the questions\\nwith your team as you interview candidates for the position.\\nThis is one of the best ways for an organization to become really\\ngood at hiring: by iterating the questions, you’re reXning what\\nyour criteria are — and how you screen for those criteria.\\nFourth, pay attention to the little things during the interview\\nprocess.\\nYou see little hints of things in the interview process that blow\\nup to disasters of unimaginable proportions once the person is\\nonboard.\\nPerson never laughs? Probably hard to get along with.\\nPerson constantly interrupts? Egomaniac, run for the hills.\\nPerson claims to be good friends with someone you know but\\nHow to hire the best people you\\'ve ever worked with 77\\nthen doesn’t know what the friend is currently doing? Bullshitter.\\nPerson gives nonlinear answers to simple questions? Complete\\ndisorganized and undisciplined on the job.\\nPerson drones on and on? Get ready for hell.\\nFiah, pay attention to the little things during the reference\\ncalls.\\n(You are doing reference calls, right?)\\nMost people soaball deXciencies in people they’ve worked with\\nwhen they do reference calls.\\n“He’s great, super-smart, blah blah blah, but…”\\n“Sometimes wasn’t that motivated” — the person is a slug,\\nyou’re going to have to kick their rear every morning to get\\nthem to do anything.\\n“Could sometimes be a little hard to get along with” — hugely\\nunpleasant.\\n“Had an easier time working with men than women” — raging\\nsexist.\\n“Was sometimes a little moody” — suWering from clinical\\ndepression, and unmedicated.\\nYou get the picture.\\nSixth, Hx your mistakes fast… but not too fast.\\nIf you are super-scrupulous about your hiring process, you’ll\\nstill have maybe a 70% success rate of a new person really working out — if you’re lucky.\\nAnd that’s for individual contributors.\\nIf you’re hiring executives, you’ll probably only have a 50% success rate.\\n78 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nThat’s life.\\nAnyone who tells you otherwise is hiring poorly and doesn’t\\nrealize it.\\nMost startups in my experience are undisciplined at Xxing hiring mistakes — i.e., Xring people who aren’t working out.\\nFirst, realize that while you’re going to hate Xring someone,\\nyou’re going to feel way better aaer the fact than you can currently imagine.\\nSecond, realize that the great people on your team will be happy\\nthat you’ve done it — they knew the person wasn’t working out,\\nand they want to work with other great people, and so they’ll\\nbe happy that you’ve done the right thing and kept the average\\nhigh.\\n(The reason I say “not too fast” is because your great people are watching to see how you Xre people, and if you do it too\\nfast you’ll be viewed as arbitrary and capricious — but trust me,\\nmost startup managers do not have this problem, they have the\\nopposite problem.)\\nThird, realize that you’re usually doing the person you’re Xring\\na favor — you’re releasing them from a role where they aren’t\\ngoing to succeed or get promoted or be valued, and you’re giving them the opportunity to Xnd a better role in a diWerent company where they very well might be an incredible star.\\n(And if they can’t, were they really the kind of person you\\nwanted to hire in the Xrst place?)\\nOne of the good things about our industry is that there are\\nfrequently lots of new jobs being created and so you’re almost\\nnever pushing someone out onto the street — so don’t feel that\\nyou’re dooming their families to the poorhouse, because you\\naren’t.\\nYou’re not that important in their lives.\\nHow to hire the best people you\\'ve ever worked with 79\\nI can name a number of people I’ve Xred or participated in Xring who have gone on to be quite successful at other companies.\\nThey won’t necessarily talk to me anymore, though :-).\\nFinally, although this goes without saying: value the hell out of\\nthe great people you do have on your team. Given all of the\\nabove, they are incredibly special people.\\n80 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nThe Pmarca Guide to Big\\nCompanies\\nPart 1: Turnaround!\\nSo you’ve been hired/promoted/brought out of retirement to\\nbecome CEO of and turn around your NASDAQ/NYSE/LSElisted 5,000+ employee soMware/semiconductor/media company\\nthat’s recently been getting trounced by competitors, brutalized\\nby the press, and savaged in the stock market.\\nHere’s your turnaround plan in 9 easy steps.\\nStep 1: Go dark and execute.\\nYour predecessor in the CEO job inevitably spent way too much\\ntime explaining to reporters, investors, analysts, and anyone else\\nwho would listen why your company was actually doing just Xne\\nand how brighter times were just around the corner as your\\ncompetitive position deteriorated and your Xnancial results fell\\napart, and nobody believed it anyway.\\nMoney talks, hype walks — when you’re hitting your numbers,\\neveryone thinks you’re a genius and believes everything you\\nsay, no matter how silly. When you’re not hitting your numbers,\\neveryone thinks you’re a moron and won’t believe anything you\\nsay, no matter how true.\\nSo go dark, focus on the business, and don’t talk publicly for at\\nleast six months.\\nStep 2: But Frst, throw your predecessor completely under the bus.\\nCan’t forget this one! Tell Wall Street that your predecessor\\nwas such an incredibly dim bulb that in retrospect you can’t\\neven understand how he got past security and into the building,\\nmuch less was picked to be CEO. He completely fouled the\\nXnancials and sabotaged the business and as a result, earnings\\nfor the next several quarters are going to come in way below\\nexpectations.\\nThe fun part about this one is that your stock won’t even drop\\nbecause everyone has already Xgured that out.\\nStep 3: Identify the 3-5 things that are working surprisingly well in\\nyour business, and double down on those.\\nAny big company, no matter how moribund and poorly run, has\\na number of products and projects that are going better than\\nexpected — and usually come as a complete surprise.\\nDrawing on Peter Drucker’s classic admonition to “focus on\\nopportunities, not problems”, Xgure out what these surprise successes are and double down on them.\\nPromote their general managers, elevate their business units in\\nthe organization, give them more funding, and get out of the\\nway.\\nStep 4: Identify the 3-5 things that are consuming a lot of money and\\ntime and yet going nowhere, and kill those.\\nA good starting point is your predecessor’s pet projects — line\\n‘em up and shoot ‘em.\\nFrankly, they don’t even have to be consuming that much\\nmoney. They’re almost certainly consuming time and management bandwidth, and they need to go.\\nYou can also consider this a warmup exercise for Step 5.\\nStep 5: Lay oE a third of the workforce.\\nHere’s why:\\nHistory shows that you’re going to have to ultimately do it anyPart 1: Turnaround! 83\\nway, either via death of a thousand cuts (or six to eight distinct\\nrounds of layoWs), or all at once.\\nSo do it all at once.\\nA company that requires a turnaround has, in all likelihood, hired\\ntoo many people for the size of the business opportunity it actually\\nhas. This impairs proXtability, driving away investors and submergingthestockpriceatpreciselythetimethecompanyneedsahealthy\\nacquisition currency; this demotivates your great people by surrounding them by too many mediocre people and too much\\nbureaucracy; and this slows everything in your company to a crawl\\nbecause there are simply too many people running around who have to talk\\nabout everything before anything gets done.\\nGrit your teeth, oWer the most generous severance and assistance packages you possibly can, and get it done.\\nYour ability to continue to employ the other two-thirds of your\\npeople is at stake.\\nStep 6: Reduce layers, then promote up and comers and put them\\nclearly in charge.\\nA company that requires a turnaround has, in all likelihood, too\\nmany layers of management. Nuke as many of them as you can.\\nThen develop a list of your top 20 or 30 up and comers —\\nstrong, sharp, aggressive, ambitious director- or VP-level managers who want to succeed and want your company to succeed.\\nAnd promote them, and put them in sole charge of clearly identiXed teams and missions. (And give them big ol’ fresh option\\npackages.)\\nAs CEO, you should only have at most one executive between\\nyou and these 20 or 30 up and comers once you are done promoting them and putting them in charge of their teams and\\nmissions.\\nIf you don’t know who those top 20 or 30 up and comers are, if\\nyou don’t promote them, if you don’t put them clearly in charge\\nof the things that matter, or if you have more than one layer of\\n84 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nmanagement between you and them when you’re done, you’re\\nprobably doomed.\\nStep 7: Figure out the single most important thing your company has\\nto win at, and put your single best person in charge of winning at it.\\n‘NuW said.\\nStep 8: Look at the market, Fgure out 3-5 new areas in which your\\ncompany is not currently playing or winning, but are clearly going to\\ngrow a lot — and acquire the best company in each of those areas.\\nHere you’re looking for growth — for products, trends, perhaps\\nphenomena outside but adjacent to your current products and\\nmarkets, that are going to grow a lot in the next few years.\\nYou have to acquire, because if you’re in a turnaround situation,\\nyou aren’t going to have the time or bandwidth to build them\\nin-house — unless you’re the very rare exception.\\nWhen you do acquire, you’re going to have to pay up, because\\nnew things that are growing really fast in growth markets are\\nalways expensive — whether private or public — especially\\ncompared to the PE multiple of a big company in turnaround.\\nSo here’s hoping you did a great job at Step 5.\\nStep 9: In six months, relaunch the company with a single, crisp,\\ncoherent message and strategy.\\nThen go dark again and go right back to work.\\nOf course, there’s more to being the CEO of a turnaround than\\nthese 9 steps. There are a thousand other things you’re going to\\nhave to do. But these are the 9 most important.\\nTo quote the great Tommy Lasorda: “This fucking job ain’t that\\nfucking easy.”\\nAppendix for media companies only:\\nStep 10: For God’s sake, stop suing your customers.\\nPart 1: Turnaround! 85\\nPart 2: Retaining great people\\nThis post is about retaining great people, particularly at big companies in industries like technology, where stock options matter\\nand where people can relatively easily move from one company\\nto another.\\nActually, I lied. This post isn’t really about retention at all.\\nIt’s about winning.\\nLet me explain:\\nCompanies that are winning — even really big, old ones — never\\nhave a retention problem. Everyone wants to stay, and when someone does leave, it’s really easy to get someone great to take her\\nplace.\\nCompanies that have a retention problem usually have a winning problem. Or rather, a “not winning” problem.\\nThe typical case is a company that used to be a hot growth company, but the growth has Yattened out, causing the stock to tank\\nand everyone to be in a bad mood. Or, alternately, an older\\nbig company that did really well for a while but more recently\\nhasn’t been doing so well, causing the stock to tank and everyone to be in a bad mood.\\nIn other words, a company in transition — from winning at one\\npoint, to not winning now.\\nThe only way a company in that situation can retain great people is to start winning again.\\nGreat people want to work at a winner.\\nAll the raises, perks, and HR-sponsored “company values” draaing sessions in the world won’t help you retain great people if\\nyou’re not winning — not even the $6,000 heated Japanese toilets in all the restrooms, the $30,000 Olympic lap pool out back,\\nand the free $4 bottles of organic orange juice in all the snack\\nrooms.\\nThis seems deeply unfair when you’re going through it, because\\nwhen you’re not winning, that’s exactly when you need all those\\ngreat people the most!\\nOh well. That’s the price we pay for living in a society where\\njobs aren’t for life anymore.\\nSo the right question is, how can we start\\nwinning again?\\nIn this post, I’m going to punt on large parts of the answer to\\nthat question, as follows:\\n• I already discussed the big company turnaround scenarioin\\nmy last post in this series, which describes how to take a big\\ncompany that is no longer winning and set it up to win again.\\n• A company that was a hot startup a few years ago and grew\\nfast but is now seeing growth slow has a slightly diWerent\\nproblem — your original product cycle has peaked and you\\nneed to Xnd a new product cycle. That’s your big challenge,\\nway beyond retention. But I’ll talk about that in a future post.\\nRetention follows from the steps you are taking to orchestrate\\nthe turnaround and/or get to the next big product cycle.\\nHaving adroitly sidestepped most of what you need to do, let\\nme now address some things you can do to help the retention\\nPart 2: Retaining great people 87\\nsituation while you are addressing the deeper issues required to\\nwin again.\\nFirst, don’t give up. I am particularly talking about the former hot\\nstartup that is now a large slow-growth company. It is easy to\\nsay, well, we’re not a startup anymore, we’re not a growth company anymore — now we’re a big company, and we need to\\nchange our culture and our methods to attract and retain the\\nkinds of people who like to work at big companies.\\nDoing that will make your situation far worse, by causing the\\nremaining great people you do have to abandon ship even\\nfaster. Who wants to work for a company that has given up on\\nhaving energy and drive and ambition? And then you will end\\nup with a staW that only knows how to be a big company —\\nthat only knows how to maintain something that someone else\\nhas already built — which is death in any industry where things\\nchange all the time.\\nSecond, focus. In a technology company, focus on retaining the\\ngreat architects and managers. In other kinds of companies,\\nfocus on retaining the equivalent people — the people who are\\nthe magnets for retaining other great people and hiring more\\ngreat people.\\nYou have to retain the magnets — or at least a critical mass of\\nthem — because without them, you’re going to lose everyone\\nelse.\\nIf you bear down and focus on retaining the magnets, retaining\\neveryone else — for example, in a soaware company, the junior\\nprogrammers, the product managers, the user interface designers, the salespeople, the sales engineers, the marketing staW, and\\nso on — will be much easier.\\nThird, clean house. Any company with a retention problem probably also has an overstaZng problem and a mediocrity problem\\nand needs to Xx both of those at the same time.\\nIdentify and eliminate the jobs of the following categories of\\npeople:\\n88 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\n• People who are “vesting in peace” — so called “VIPs”. VIPs are\\na particular problem at the former hot startup that has\\nplateaued. They suck the life out of their environment and\\nhave to go.\\n• “Summertime soldiers” — people who only joined in the Xrst\\nplace because you were already successful and have no\\ninterest in really bearing down and applying themselves to a\\nchallenge. Again, a classic problem for the former hot\\nstartup. Look particularly hard at the people who joined in\\nthe two years following the IPO — some of them are\\nundoubtedly very hard working, but others are summertime\\nsoldiers and have to go.\\n• Mediocre performers — every company has some, unless\\nyou have been routinely Xring your bottom 10% every year,\\nand even then you probably have some.\\nTaking out the people who fall into these categories will make\\nyour remaining great people feel better immediately, and will\\nsave you a lot of money and stock options that you can reallocate to better purposes — such as new compensation packages\\nfor your remaining great people.\\nFourth, promote your best people — especially into the jobs vacated\\nby the more senior of the people you just Xred — and give them\\nvery interesting challenges.\\nThat is so fundamental that I’m not even going to discuss it further here.\\nFiMh, simplify and clarify your organizational structure to make sure\\nthat your best people have direct responsibility for their projects.\\nCompanies coming oW a period of signiXcant success usually\\nhave grown a lot and/or bought a lot of other companies, and\\ntypically have messy or overly complex org structures. This is a\\ngreat opportunity to clean that up — and in particular, to move\\nto an organizational model where each of your stars has clear,\\ndirect, and comprehensive responsibility for a critical mission.\\nPart 2: Retaining great people 89\\nNuke all matrices. Nuke all dual reporting structures. And nuke\\nas many shared services functions as you possibly can.\\nFor example, in a soaware company, break up the centralized\\ndocumentation group, QA group, build group, etc. and disperse\\nthose people into the individual product divisions. Give your\\nproduct division heads complete responsibility for everything\\nthey need to ship great products — except for sales. And then in\\nsales, give your territory heads everything they need to kill their\\nnumbers.\\nA great general rule of thumb for this kind of organizational\\nredesign is that you want to tolerate overlap. So each product\\ndivision has its own QA team — so what? Your division heads —\\nwho are now your best people — will be able to move so much\\nfaster that way that it’s worth it. Plus, you saved so much money\\ntaking out the VIPs, summertime soldiers, and mediocre people\\nthat you’re still ahead on headcount expense.\\nRemember, it’s generally a good idea, once you do all of this\\nrestructuring, to end up with smaller team sizes than you had\\nbefore. By reducing the size of a team, and increasing the average quality level within the team, you will usually speed things\\nup, while saving money.\\nFinally, be sure to take out layers — especially at the top of the\\ncompany. The best people who are now running all the key projects and divisions should be no more than one layer away from\\nthe CEO, and usually that means you can take out at least one\\nlayer, maybe two, and (shudder) maybe even more.\\nSixth, put the recruiters to work, aggressively — but don’t rely on them\\nfor everything.\\nNotably, for the really critical open jobs, go out and recruit the\\nright person yourself, or better yet promote from within.\\nAnd here’s a neat trick that actually works. Go out and re-recruit\\nthe best people who already lea. Some of them have since\\ndiscovered that the grass isn’t actually greener at whatever\\nmediocre startup they joined or whatever other big company\\n90 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nthey jumped to. Give them fat packages against the new mission\\nand get them back.\\nSeventh, ramp up college recruiting. This will be very important for\\nyou over the next couple years. College recruiting is the best\\nway to get a bunch of new Xred up people into your company\\nwho are hungry and who don’t realize quite how badly you suck.\\n(That was a joke.)\\nEighth, communicate within — tell everyone in your company\\nclearly and unambiguously, we are here to win and here’s how\\nwe’re going to do it. It won’t be easy, but we can do it and we will do\\nit, and we will have amazing stories to tell our grandchildren.\\nYou don’t need to be certain of all the answers! Colin Powell\\nsays, “You know you’re a good leader when people follow you, if\\nonly out of curiosity.” So project boldness, and have that glint in\\nyour eye where people know you’re up to something big.\\nNinth, shake things up. Directly on Powell’s curiosity point —\\nchange the story to something new. Overhaul the organization,\\nmove people around, Xre people, promote other people, cancel\\nproducts, double down on other products, do some acquisitions,\\ncut some big deals, do some spinoWs, whatever — but change\\nthe story. Reintroduce curiosity.\\nWhen all else fails, do a “shake and bake” — do a big transformative deal that you’re not sure will work but which you think\\nhas a real shot. That will at the very least inject energy back into\\nthe situation.\\nI am being deliberately cavalier about this tactic, especially the\\n“shake and bake” part. You can easily destroy your company\\nwith this kind of move.\\nBut — and this is a very important but — a company in crisis\\noaen has a severe narrative or “story” problem that accompanies its business problems, and it can be hard to get people\\ninside and outside the company motivated to reengage without\\nyou forcing a dramatic change to the story in some fundamental\\nway.\\nPart 2: Retaining great people 91\\nStories don’t change by themselves. Change the story.\\nNext topic: how to talk a great person out\\nof going to a startup\\nI’m assuming based on all of the above that if you do the blocking and tackling right, you’re going to be able to convince a lot\\nof your great people to not go to a diWerent big company.\\nTalking someone out of going to a startup is a separate challenge.\\nSomeone usually wants to move from a big company to a\\nstartup for one or more of the following four reasons:\\nFirst, she wants to build a new company instead of being a caretaker in\\nsomeone else’s company.\\nYou can talk someone out of this if you can show her how, if\\nshe stays with you for two more years, you are going to concretely better train and prepare her to kick butt at a startup when\\nshe does make such a move — particularly if she is on the management track.\\nGive her a promotion, a big new job with a big new challenge,\\nand clear responsibility. And tell her that if she kicks butt at this\\nmore signiXcant challenge, she’ll not only be better prepared to\\nbe out on her own, but you will personally give her glowing recommendations and help her Xnd the perfect startup or the perfect VC for her — in two years.\\nThen, two years later, you can do the same thing again.\\nI believe you are doing someone a huge favor when you do this.\\nMost startups aren’t very good and have no prospect of real success, and most big company people aren’t very good at picking\\n‘em, although they never believe that.

Most people who\\nsay they want career planning advice aren’t actually looking for\\nadvice — they just want validation of the path they have already\\nchosen. Because of that, giving someone career planning advice\\nis one of the surest ways to end up feeling like an a******.\\nHowever, as with so many other things, career planning is a\\ntopic about which I have plenty of opinions. And since I started\\nthis blog, I’ve received a lot of questions from people who are\\nlooking for career planning advice. So, this series of posts will\\npresent my opinions on career planning in today’s world.\\nDisclaimers:\\n• These posts are aimed at high-potential people who want to\\nexcel throughout their careers and make a signiXcant impact\\non their Xelds and the world. These posts are not appropriate\\nfor people for whom work/life balance is a high priority or\\nfor whom lifestyle is particularly important — if that’s you,\\nthere are plenty of existing career planning resources for you\\nalready!\\n• My background is biased towards high-tech companies and\\nSilicon Valley, and my advice will be most relevant to people\\nentering either my industry or other industries that are like\\nmy industry — fast moving, rapidly changing, and\\ncharacterized by lots of new companies and lots of\\nopportunity for new people. Some of this advice may be\\napplicable to people entering other kinds of Xelds — but I\\nwouldn’t know and I won’t guarantee it.\\n• I’ll use a lot of words like “ambition” and “promotion” and\\n“gaining more responsibility”. It may seem like I’m talking\\nabout moving up through the management ranks and\\nmanaging more and more people, but my intention is for all\\nof this advice to be equally relevant to people in purely\\ntechnical careers, such as soaware programming. If you\\naren’t interesting in managing people, then when I talk about\\npromotion and advancement, just think about getting\\nbroader latitude to work on or lead more complex technical\\nprojects, assuming more technical seniority within a\\ncompany, and the like.\\n• Everything that follows is purely personal opinion —\\nspeciXcally, these are the things I would want to know if I\\nwere entering college today. I’m sure there are many equally\\nvalid counterpoints to each of my points, and I look forward\\nto reading them on other people’s blogs!\\n98 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nPart 1: Opportunity\\nThe Hrst rule of career planning: Do not plan your career.\\nThe world is an incredibly complex place and everything is\\nchanging all the time. You can’t plan your career because you have\\nno idea what’s going to happen in the future. You have no idea what\\nindustries you’ll enter, what companies you’ll work for, what\\nroles you’ll have, where you’ll live, or what you will ultimately\\ncontribute to the world. You’ll change, industries will change,\\nthe world will change, and you can’t possibly predict any of it.\\nTrying to plan your career is an exercise in futility that will only\\nserve to frustrate you, and to blind you to the really signiXcant\\nopportunities that life will throw your way.\\nCareer planning = career limiting.\\nThe sooner you come to grips with that, the better.\\nThe second rule of career planning: Instead of planning your\\ncareer, focus on developing skills and pursuing opportunities.\\nI’ll talk a lot about skills development in the next post. But for\\nthe rest of this post, I’m going to focus in on the nature of opportunities.\\nOpportunities are key. I would argue that opportunities fall loosely\\ninto two buckets: those that present themselves to you, and\\nthose that you go out and create. Both will be hugely important\\nto your career.\\nOpportunities that present themselves to you are the consequence — at least partially — of being in the right place at the\\nright time. They tend to present themselves when you’re not\\nexpecting it — and oaen when you are engaged in other activities\\nthat would seem to preclude you from pursuing them. And\\nthey come and go quickly — if you don’t jump all over an opportunity, someone else generally will and it will vanish.\\nI believe a huge part of what people would like to refer to as\\n“career planning” is being continuously alert to opportunities\\nthat present themselves to you spontaneously, when you happen to be in the right place at the right time.\\n• A senior person at your Xrm is looking for someone young\\nand hungry to do the legwork on an important project, in\\naddition to your day job.\\n• Your former manager has jumped ship to a hot growth\\ncompany and calls you three months later and says, come\\njoin me.\\n• Or, a small group of your smartest friends are headed to\\nDenny’s at 11PM to discuss an idea for a startup — would you\\nlike to come along?\\nI am continually amazed at the number of people who are presented with an opportunity like one of the above, and pass.\\nThere’s your basic dividing line between the people who shoot up in\\ntheir careers like a rocket ship, and those who don’t — right there.\\nThe second bucket of opportunities are those you seek out and\\ncreate. A lot of what will follow in future posts in this series\\nwill discuss how to do that. However, let me say up front that I\\nam also continually amazed at the number of people who coast\\nthrough life and don’t go and seek out opportunities even when\\nthey know in their gut what they’d really like to do. Don’t be one\\nof those people. Life is way too short.\\nThe world is a very malleable place. If you know what you want,\\nand you go for it with maximum energy and drive and passion,\\n100 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nthe world will oaen reconXgure itself around you much more\\nquickly and easily than you would think.\\nNow, I’m not proposing that you simply ping pong from\\nopportunity to opportunity randomly. You can have a strategy.\\nAnd here’s how I think that strategy should work.\\nPeople who manage money professionally don’t think about\\nindividual investments in isolation; they think of those investments as part of an overall portfolio. Each investment has its\\npotential return — the beneXt you get from owning it — and its\\npotential risks — the things that can go wrong. A portfolio, then,\\nis a set of investments, and the portfolio assumes the return and\\nrisk characteristics of all of the investments blended together.\\nViewed in that context, it is oaen logical to have individual\\ninvestments within a portfolio that are far more risky than one\\nwould normally Xnd comfortable — if the potential return is\\ngood enough. Or, investments that are far less risky and have far\\nless return potential than one would normally want — to protect one’s downside. The risk of any individual investment is not\\nimportant; what is important is how the risks — and the potential returns — of all of the investments combine in the overall\\nportfolio.\\nI believe you should look at your career as a portfolio of jobs/\\nroles/opportunities. Each job that you take, each role that you\\nchoose to Xll, each opportunity you pursue, will have a certain\\npotential return — the beneXts you can get from taking it,\\nwhether those beneXts come in the form of income, skill development, experience, geographic location, or something else.\\nEach job will also have a certain risk proXle — the things that\\ncould go wrong, from getting Xred for not being able to handle\\nthe job’s demands, to having to move somewhere you don’t\\nwant to, to the company going bankrupt, to the opportunity cost\\nof not pursuing some other attractive opportunity.\\nOnce you start thinking this way, you can think strategically\\nabout your career over its likely 50+ year timespan.\\nFor example, when you are just out of school and have a low\\nPart 1: Opportunity 101\\nburn rate and geographic Yexibility, you can take jobs with a\\ncertain return/risk proXle. If you get married and have kids, you\\nwill take jobs with a diWerent return/risk proXle. Later, when\\nyour kids grow up and you are once again free to move about\\nand you don’t have to worry about tuition payments and a\\nmortgage on a big house in a great school district, but you now\\nhave far more experience than you did when you were Xrst\\nstarting out, you can take jobs with a third return/risk proXle.\\nMost people do not think this way. They might occasionally\\nthink this way, but they don’t do it systematically. So when\\nan opportunity pops up, they evaluate it on a standalone basis\\n— “boy, it looks risky, I’m not sure I should do it”. What you\\nshould automatically do instead is put it in context with all of\\nthe other risks you are likely to take throughout your entire\\ncareer and decide whether this new opportunity Fts strategically into\\nyour portfolio.\\nLet’s dig into the concept of risk a little more.\\nI’m not talking about the form of risk that you think of when\\nyou think of stepping out into the crosswalk and getting run\\nover by an Escalade. I’m talking about the form of risk that\\nXnancial professionals deal with (see the classic book Against\\nthe Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk for more on this), and\\nstartup entrepreneurs deal with, and that you deal with any time\\nyou make any decision. There are a set of potential downsides to\\nalmost any decision — but they can be analyzed, and oMen quantiFed,\\nand thereby brought under control.\\nWhich is important, because in life, there is generally no opportunity\\nwithout risk. Doing the legwork on that extra project for the\\nsenior person at your Xrm? You risk exhausting yourself and\\ndoing your day job poorly. Joining your former manager at\\nthat hot growth company? Maybe it tanks six months later and\\nthen your current employer won’t rehire you. Join those smart\\nfriends at Denny’s and start a new company with them? Maybe\\nit completely fails, and you have to explain why you were so\\nfoolish at every job interview you do for the rest of your\\n102 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nlife. There are always real and legitimate reasons why people oMen pass\\non opportunities — they see the risks and they wish to avoid them.\\nThe issue is that without taking risk, you can’t exploit any\\nopportunities. You can live a quiet and reasonably happy life,\\nbut you are unlikely to create something new, and you are\\nunlikely to make your mark on the world.\\nTo quote Aaron Brown — a legendary Morgan Stanley derivatives trader and poker expert — from his extraordinary\\nbook The Poker Face of Wall Street, when talking about hiring\\ntraders at an investment bank:\\nWhat I listen for is someone who really wanted something that\\ncould be obtained only through taking the risk, whether that risk\\nwas big or small.\\nIt’s not even important that she managed the risk skillfully; it’s only\\nimportant that she knew it was there, respected it, but took it anyway.\\nMost people wander through life, carelessly taking whatever risk\\ncrosses their path without compensation, but never consciously\\naccepting extra risk to pick up the money and other good things\\nlying all around them.\\nOther people reYexively avoid every risk or grab every loose dollar\\nwithout caution.\\nI don’t mean to belittle these strategies; I’m sure they make sense to\\nthe people who pursue them. I just don’t understand them myself.\\nI do know that none of these people will be successful traders.\\n…or successful at anything important in life.\\nSo, when you are presented with an opportunity, carefully\\nanalyze its risks, but:\\n• Do so within the context if your likely lifetime portfolio of\\nrisks…\\n• And do so realizing that taking risk can be a good thing when\\nit leads to pursuing the best opportunities.\\nPart 1: Opportunity 103\\nAll that said, here are some of my opinions about the kinds of\\nrisks you should take and when:\\n• When you are just out of school — and assuming that you are\\nrelatively free to move and have a low burn rate — is when\\nyou should optimize for the rate at which you can develop\\nskills and acquire experiences that will serve you well later.\\nYou should speciXcally take income risk in order to do that.\\nAlways take the job that will best develop your skills and give\\nyou valuable experiences, regardless of its salary. This is not\\nthe time in your career to play it safe.\\n• When you have family obligations — a spouse, two and a half\\nkids, a dog, and a picket fence — that’s obviously the time to\\ncrank back on the income risk and instead take a little risk\\nthat you might not learn as much or advance as quickly or\\njoin that hot new startup. However, even this is not black and\\nwhite! In Silicon Valley, for example, it can still make a lot of\\nsense for a young parent to take a risk on a hot new startup\\nbecause it will usually be easy to get another job if the startup\\nfails — especially if one has developed more useful skills and\\nexperiences along the way.\\n• There may be times when you realize that you are\\ndissatisXed with your Xeld — you are working in enterprise\\nsoaware, for example, but you’d really rather be working on\\ngreen tech or in a consumer Internet company. Jumping\\nfrom one Xeld into another is always risky because your\\nspeciXc skills and contacts are in your old Xeld, so you’ll have\\nless certainty of success in the new Xeld. This is almost always a\\nrisk worth taking– standing pat and being unhappy about it\\nhas risks of its own, particularly to your happiness. And it is\\nawfully hard to be highly successful in a job or Xeld in which\\none is unhappy.\\n• Likewise with geography risk. You start out in one city — say,\\nworking at a soaware company in Philadelphia — and you’re\\ndoing well. You get the opportunity to jump to a faster\\ngrowing soaware company in Silicon Valley. Should you take\\nthe risk of moving geographies — to a place where you don’t\\nknow anybody, and where the cost of living is higher? Almost\\n104 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\ncertainly — the additional risks of not having an extensive\\npersonal network and of tolerating a lower standard of living\\nfor some period of time are almost certainly overcome by\\nthe upside of being at a better company, relocating yourself\\nto the heart of your industry, and setting yourself up to\\nexploit many more great opportunities over the next\\ndecades.\\n• Working for a big company is, I believe, much risker than it\\nlooks. I’ll talk about this more in the next post, but people\\nwho work at big companies are subject to impersonal layoWs\\nat any time, and oaen forego the opportunity to develop\\nskills and gain experiences as rapidly as they would at\\nsomeplace smaller and faster growing. And then Xve or ten\\nyears pass, and you realize your skills and experiences are\\nonly relevant for jobs at other big companies — and then you\\nhave a real problem.\\n• Finally, pay attention to opportunity cost at all times. Doing\\none thing means not doing other things. This is a form of risk\\nthat is very easy to ignore, to your detriment.\\nThose are just a few examples. You will run into speciXc return/\\nrisk situations that nobody can predict ahead of time. When you\\ndo, just sit down and tease apart the risks — and think hard about\\nwhether, in the context of your overall career portfolio, they are\\nreally so scary that they justify passing on the return potential\\nof a great opportunity. They oaen won’t.\\nOne more quote, this time from Nassim Nicholas Taleb in The\\nBlack Swan:\\nSeize any opportunity, or anything that looks like opportunity. They are rare, much rarer than you think…\\nMany people do not realize they are getting a lucky break in life\\nwhen they get it. If a big publisher (or a big art dealer or a movie\\nexecutive or a hotshot banker or a big thinker) suggests an appointment, cancel anything you have planned: you may not see such a\\nwindow open up again.\\nOf course, if you really are high-potential, you’re naturally\\ngoing to be seeking out risks in your career in order to maxPart 1: Opportunity 105\\nimize your level of achievement, so you’re thinking, c’mon,\\nAndreessen, get to the next point. For which, see the next post!\\n106 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nPart 2: Skills and education\\n[Please read my opening disclaimers. Note especially that these\\nare only personal views; I am not trying to malign anyone else’s\\nchoice of career or education path. These are simply the\\nthings I would want to be told if I were entering college today.]\\nThis post discusses skills acquisition throughout your lifetime,\\nincluding your formal education. So I will start with college and\\nmove on from there.\\nWhat should I study in college?\\nSome people argue that college will be your one chance in life\\nto pursue your passion — to spend four years doing nothing but\\nstudying whatever you love the most, whether that’s Renaissance literature or existential philosophy.\\nI disagree.\\nIf you intend to have an impact on the world, the faster you start\\ndeveloping concrete skills that will be useful in the real world, the\\nbetter — and your undergrad degree is a great place to start.\\nOnce you get into the real world and you’re primed for success, then you can pursue your passion.\\nA typical liberal arts degree will be almost useless on its own. So\\nyou usually won’t have the option of immediately entering the\\nworkforce in a high-impact way when you graduate, and you’ll\\nhave to go get a useful graduate degree.\\nAnd even if you are already planning to get a useful graduate\\ndegree, you are much better oW combining it with a substantive\\nundergraduate degree — thereby becoming a “double threat”.\\nMore on this in a bit.\\nWhich undergraduate degrees are useful in\\nthe real world?\\nTypically, those that have a technical element of some form —\\nthat teach you how to do something substantive.\\nEngineering degrees obviously qualify. The current myth that\\nengineering and computer science degrees are less useful\\nbecause all the jobs are going to India and China is silliness;\\nignore it.\\nHard science degrees — physics, chemistry — also clearly qualify, as do mathematics and economics.\\nWhy do I take this stance?\\n• Technical degrees teach you how to do something diZcult\\nand useful that matters in the real world. Even if you don’t\\nend up actually doing what the degree teaches you how to do,\\ngoing through the experience of learning how to do it will\\nhelp you go through other serious learning experiences in\\nyour career. Complexity and diZculty will not faze you.\\n• Plus, technical degrees teach you how think like an engineer,\\na scientist, an economist, or a mathematician — how to use\\nreason, logic, and data. This is incredibly useful in the real\\nworld, which generally demands rigorous thinking on the\\npath to doing anything big.\\n• Plus, technical degrees indicate seriousness of purpose to\\nfuture employers and partners. You get coded right up front\\nas someone who is intent on doing real things.\\nGraduating with a technical degree is like heading out into the real\\n108 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nworld armed with an assault riGe instead of a dull knife. Don’t miss\\nthat opportunity because of some fuzzy romanticized view of\\nliberal arts broadening your horizons.\\nWhat graduate degrees are useful in the\\nreal world?\\nGenerally, if you have a useful undergrad degree, I think graduate degrees are overrated. You can usually hit the workforce in a\\nreal job with just an undergraduate degree and progress rapidly\\naccording to your own ability and energy from there.\\nOf course, you’re hearing this from someone who could barely\\nstand to stay in school long enough to Xnish undergrad, so take\\nthat for what it’s worth.\\nIf you don’t have a useful undergrad degree, then a useful graduate degree is deFnitely a great idea. Business, math, economics,\\nscience — something practical, substantive.\\nQuite a few people in business have paired a liberal arts undergrad degree with an MBA. They seem to do just Xne. But I think\\nthat’s a missed opportunity — much better would be an MBA\\non top of an engineering or math undergraduate degree. People with that combination are invaluable, and there aren’t nearly\\nenough of them running around.\\nAs far as PhDs are concerned — some of my best friends have\\nPhDs. However, most of the people who have a huge impact\\non the world — outside of pure research and education — do\\nnot have PhDs. Draw from that whatever conclusion you think\\nmakes sense.\\nWhat college or university should I go to?\\nTry very very hard to go to one of the best colleges or universities in the world for your chosen Xeld.\\nDon’t worry about being a small Fsh in a big pond — you want to\\nalways be in the best pond possible, because that’s how you will get\\nPart 2: Skills and education 109\\nexposed to the best people and the best opportunities in your\\nXeld.\\nIf you can’t start out in one of the top schools for your Xeld, then\\nwork your butt oW and get great grades and transfer as fast as\\nyou possibly can into a top school.\\nAnd if you can’t do that — if you end up getting your undergrad\\nat a school that’s not one of the top in your Xeld — then strongly\\nconsider pursuing a graduate degree in your Xeld at a great\\nschool for your Xeld.\\nIn this way, even if your only option is starting out at a community college, by the time you Xnish 4-6 years of education, you\\ncan vault yourself into the top tier of your Xeld.\\nWhat should I do while I’m in school?\\nI’m a huge fan of gaining practical experience in school by working during the school year, and then doing as many internships\\nand co-op programs as you can.\\nParticularly at research universities — where you want to be —\\nthere are lots of on-campus jobs that will give you highly valuable work experience. Take a job that will teach you something useful\\nand practical — the two obvious examples are working for a professor in your Xeld with an active research program who needs\\nundergrads to do some of the work, and being a staW member at\\na campus computer lab or research lab.\\nAnd then aggressively pursue internship and co-op programs — to\\nget real-world working experience at companies in your Xeld,\\nbefore you even graduate. Target the best companies in your\\nXeld, and go aaer the opportunities early and oaen.\\nIf you do this right, by the time you graduate even with just an\\nundergrad degree, you can have a year and a half of real working experience at high-quality companies plus another four\\nyears of practical experience from an on-campus job under\\nyour belt.\\n110 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nPlus, you will be implicitly demonstrating to future employers how determined you are to succeed and how hard you are willing\\nto work.\\nIn contrast, almost any other way you can spend your time\\nwhile in school aside from getting reasonably good grades is a\\nmistake.\\nHow should I think about skills\\ndevelopment once I’m out of school?\\nYou should view graduating from school as just the beginning of\\nyour development of a whole portfolio of useful skills.\\nOne of the single best ways you can maximize the impact you\\nwill have on the world and the success you will have in your\\ncareer is by continuously developing and broadening your base of\\nskills.\\nMy favorite way of thinking about this is:\\nSeek to be a double/triple/quadruple threat.\\nScott Adams — the creator of Dilbert — nails it:\\nIf you want an average successful life, it doesn’t take much planning. Just stay out of trouble, go to school, and apply for jobs you\\nmight like. But if you want something extraordinary, you have two\\npaths:\\n• Become the best at one speciXc thing.\\n• Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things.\\nThe Xrst strategy is diZcult to the point of near impossibility. Few\\npeople will ever play in the NBA or make a platinum album. I don’t\\nrecommend anyone even try.\\nThe second strategy is fairly easy. Everyone has at least a few areas\\nin which they could be in the top 25% with some eWort. In my case,\\nI can draw better than most people, but I’m hardly an artist. And\\nI’m not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never\\nmakes it big, but I’m funnier than most people. The magic is that\\nfew people can draw well and write jokes. It’s the combination of\\nthe two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my busiPart 2: Skills and education 111\\nness background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could\\nhope to understand without living it.\\n…Get a degree in business on top of your engineering degree, law\\ndegree, medical degree, science degree, or whatever. Suddenly\\nyou’re in charge, or maybe you’re starting your own company\\nusing your combined knowledge.\\nCapitalism rewards things that are both rare and valuable. You\\nmake yourself rare by combining two or more “pretty goods” until\\nno one else has your mix…\\nIt sounds like generic advice, but you’d be hard pressed to Xnd any\\nsuccessful person who didn’t have about three skills in the top 25%.\\nThe fact is, this is even the secret formula to becoming a CEO. All\\nsuccessful CEO’s are like this. They are almost never the best\\nproduct visionaries, or the best salespeople, or the best marketing people, or the best Xnance people, or even the best managers, but they are top 25% in some set of those skills, and\\nthen all of a sudden they’re qualiXed to actually run something\\nimportant.\\nYou can apply this principle to the degrees you can choose to\\nget in school.\\nI already talked about combining an undergrad engineering\\ndegree with an MBA. I’ll hire as many of those people as I possibly can.\\nAn MBA plus a law degree can be a great combination — and\\nprobably far more useful than either of those degrees by themselves.\\nOr even combine two undergrad degrees — computer science\\nplus physics, say, or physics plus economics.\\nYou can also apply this principle to skills that you develop once\\nyou leave school.\\nLet me cite as examples Fve skills that you can develop once you\\nleave school that, in combination with your degree or degrees\\nand your other skills, can help maximize your potential:\\n112 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nFirst, communication.\\nBack to Scott Adams:\\nI always advise young people to become good public speakers (top\\n25%). Anyone can do it with practice. If you add that talent to any\\nother, suddenly you’re the boss of the people who have only one\\nskill…\\nAt least one of the skills in your mixture should involve communication, either written or verbal.\\nThe great thing about communication is that most people are\\nterrible at it, because they never take it seriously as a skill to\\ndevelop.\\nThis is particularly true of engineers and technical people, who\\noaen quaintly believe that the world works logically and that\\npeople will automatically recognize the quality of things.\\nHa!\\nOf course, communication is critically important because it’s\\nhow you convey information and concepts to lots of people in\\nways that will cause them to change their behavior.\\nThis is one good argument for certain liberal arts undergrad\\ndegrees, such as English. But you don’t need speciXc college\\ntraining to be a good communicator — you can learn communication many other ways, including by doing, by practicing, by\\ntaking classes (how about a class in standup comedy? I’m serious!), and by reading a lot. And communication in combination\\nwith some other useful skill is much more powerful than communication alone.\\nAn engineer or a Xnance person or a lawyer who can communicate is hugely more valuable than one who cannot.\\nAnd in the long run, you are going to have a very hard time ever\\nchanging the world if you can’t communicate really well.\\nSecond, management.\\nIf at all possible, learn how to manage people.\\nPart 2: Skills and education 113\\nThe best way is to learn from a great manager.\\nEarly in your career, make sure you are working for a great\\nmanager — you’ll know her when you see her in action — and\\nthen ask her to teach you how to do it.\\nAnd then give it a shot — ask for and get responsibility for a\\nteam of people whom you manage.\\nEven if your career path won’t involve managing lots of people,\\nbeing able to manage will give you a highly valuable tool that\\nyou can pull out whenever you need it, instead of forcing you to\\nalways be reliant on other people to manage.\\nWorst case, you’ll understand a lot more about why companies\\nwork the way they do and why people are the way they are.\\nWhich is hugely helpful when you set about doing something\\nnew.\\nThird, sales.\\nLearn how to sell.\\nI don’t mean, learn how to sell someone a set of steak knives\\nthey don’t need — although I hear that can be quite an education by itself.\\nI mean, learn how to convince people that something is in their\\nbest interest to do, even when they don’t realize it up front.\\nThink of this as the art of being able to interact with people\\nsuch that they will do what you want, predictably and repeatedly, as long as you are making sense and oWering them something they should want.\\nThis is another terribly underrated skill, at least among people\\nwho aren’t professional salespeople. But it’s an incredibly general skill that can be helpful not only in your career but\\nthroughout your entire life. Knowing how to sell can also help\\nyou recruit, raise money, talk to investors, create business partnerships,\\ndeal with reporters and analysts, and more — even, God help you,\\nin your marriage and with your kids.\\n114 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nSpending a year or more in an actual salesforce can be a superb\\nidea even if you have no intention of making your career in\\nsales. John Doerr once told me that the year he spent “carrying\\na bag” in sales at Intel in the late 70’s was the most valuable year\\nof his life in terms of skills development — skills he now uses\\nevery day as one of the world’s most successful venture capitalists. If you’ve ever had John Doerr try to talk you into something, you’ll know what he means.\\nFourth, Hnance.\\nA strong level of Xnancial literacy — Xnancial theory, understanding Xnancial statements, budgeting and planning, corporate structure, how equity and debt markets work — will be a\\nhuge boost for almost any career.\\nAgain, this is a more general skill that it appears to be — having\\nXnancial skills will also help you in your personal life, as well as\\nin any nonproXt organizations in which you participate.\\nAnd if you ever want to start your own company, being Xnancially literate will be a huge help.\\nIf you’re, for example, a programmer working at a tech company and you don’t know anything about Xnance, go Xnd a\\nXnance person and oWer to teach her all about soaware in return\\nfor her teaching you all about Xnance.\\nOtherwise, Xnance is something you can easily learn by taking\\nclasses, or by reading books.\\nAlso, make an investment in yourself by reading the Financial\\nTimes and the Wall Street Journal every day. Read those two\\npapers cover to cover for Xve years and you’ll know a lot of\\nwhat you need to know. (This recommendation will be even\\nmore practical once Rupert Murdoch makes the Wall Street Journal web site free.

But almost any international exposure is likely to be helpful.\\nThis is another of those skills where there’s both a pragmatic\\nbeneXt — you will have experience on the ground with people\\nin a speciXc country — and a general beneXt — you will know\\nhow to think more broadly than the average American, or\\nAmerican president, who has never been out of the country.\\nThere aren’t very many interesting businesses anymore that\\ndon’t have a strong international element — in fact, many\\nAmerican companies now generate the majority of their revenue and proXt outside the US. Having a global perspective can\\nonly help you maximize your future opportunities.\\nAny 7nal thoughts on education?\\nYes.\\nIf you’re in college now, or about to graduate from college, and\\nyou come from an upper middle class background — especially\\nif you are going to an Ivy League school — take the time to\\nread a provocative essay David Brooks wrote several years ago\\ncalled “The Organization Kid”.\\n116 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nSome excerpts:\\nI asked several [Ivy League] students to describe their daily schedules, and their replies sounded like a session of Future Workaholics\\nof America: crew practice at dawn, classes in the morning, residentadviser duty, lunch, study groups, classes in the aaernoon, tutoring\\ndisadvantaged kids in Trenton, a cappella practice, dinner, study,\\nscience lab, prayer session, hit the StairMaster, study a few hours\\nmore…\\n[N]owhere did I Xnd any real unhappiness with this state of aWairs;\\nnowhere did I Xnd anybody who seriously considered living any\\nother way. These super-accomplished kids aren’t working so hard\\nbecause they are compelled to… It’s not the stick that drives them\\non, it’s the carrot. Opportunity lures them… [I]n a rich informationage country like America, promises of enjoyable work abound — at\\nleast for people as smart and ambitious as these. “I want to be this\\nbusy,” one young woman insisted, aaer she had described a daily\\nschedule that would count as slave-driving if it were imposed on\\nanyone…\\nThat doesn’t mean that these leaders-in-training are money-mad\\n(though they are certainly career-conscious). It means they are\\ngoal-oriented. An activity — whether it is studying, hitting the\\ntreadmill, drama group, community service, or one of the student\\ngroups they found and join in great numbers — is rarely an end\\nin itself. It is a means for self-improvement, résumé-building, and\\nenrichment. College is just one step on the continual stairway of\\nadvancement, and they are always aware that they must get to the\\nnext step (law school, medical school, whatever) so that they can\\nprogress up the steps aaer that…\\nThey’re not trying to buck the system; they’re trying to climb it,\\nand they are streamlined for ascent…\\nKids of all stripes [today] lead lives that are structured, supervised,\\nand stuWed with enrichment… Today’s elite kids are likely to spend\\ntheir aaernoons and weekends shuttling from one skill-enhancing\\nactivity to the next. By the time they reach college, they take this\\nsort of pace for granted…\\nIn short, at the top of the meritocratic ladder we have in America\\na generation of students who are extraordinarily bright, morally\\nearnest, and incredibly industrious. They like to study and socialize\\nin groups. They create and join organizations with great enthusiasm. They are responsible, safety-conscious, and mature. They feel\\nno compelling need to rebel — not even a hint of one. They not\\nonly defer to authority; they admire it. “Alienation” is a word one\\nPart 2: Skills and education 117\\nalmost never hears from them. They regard the universe as beneficent, orderly, and meaningful. At the schools and colleges where\\nthe next leadership class is being bred, one Xnds not angry revolutionaries, despondent slackers, or dark cynics but the Organization\\nKid.\\nNow, if your parents are middle class, or lower middle class,\\nand you’re attending a state school or a local college, and you’re\\nworking your way through school in order to pay for tuition,\\nyou can stop reading now; you probably don’t have anything to\\nworry about. But if you read Brooks’ essay and recognize yourself, read on.\\nThe good news is that Brooks’ fundamental thesis is correct: kids\\ngraduating from top colleges and universities today are in many ways\\nbetter prepared for achievement and success than ever before. As a\\ngroup, you are better educated, better trained, more motivated,\\nand more serious than many of your predecessors. And that is\\nfantastic.\\nThe risk, however, is this:\\nIf you have lived an orchestrated existence, gone to great\\nschools, participated in lots of extracurricular activities, had\\nparents who really concentrated hard on developing you\\nbroadly and exposing you to lots of cultural experiences, and\\ngraduated from an elite university in the Xrst 22 or more years\\nof your life, you are in danger of entering the real world, being\\nsmacked hard across the face by reality, and never recovering.\\nWhat do I mean? It’s possible you got all the way through those\\nXrst 22 or more years and are now entering the workforce without ever really challenging yourself. This sounds silly because\\nyou’ve been working hard your whole life, but working hard\\nis not what I’m talking about. You’ve been continuously surrounded by a state of the art parental and educational support\\nstructure — a safety net — and you have yet to make tough decisions,\\nby yourself, in the absence of good information, and to live with the\\nconsequences of screwing up.\\nIn my opinion, it’s now critically important to get into the real\\nworld and really challenge yourself — expose yourself to risk\\n118 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\n— put yourself in situations where you will succeed or fail by\\nyour own decisions and actions, and where that success or failure will be highly visible.\\nBy failure I don’t mean getting a B or even a C, but rather: having\\nyour boss yell at you in front of your peers for screwing up a\\nproject, launching a product and seeing it tank, being unable to\\nmeet a ship date, missing a critical piece of information in a\\nXnancial report, or getting Xred.\\nWhy? If you’re going to be a high achiever, you’re going to be\\nin lots of situations where you’re going to be quickly making decisions in the presence of incomplete or incorrect information, under\\nintense time pressure, and oMen under intense political pressure. You’re\\ngoing to screw up — frequently — and the screwups will have\\nserious consequences, and you’ll feel incredibly stupid every\\ntime. It can’t faze you — you have to be able to just get right back up\\nand keep on going.\\nThat may be the most valuable skill you can ever learn. Make\\nsure you start learning it early.\\nPart 2: Skills and education 119\\nPart 3: Where to go and why\\nWhen picking an industry to enter, my favorite rule of thumb is\\nthis:\\nPick an industry where the founders of the industry — the\\nfounders of the important companies in the industry — are\\nstill alive and actively involved.\\nThis is easy to Xgure out — just look at the CEO, chairman or\\nchairwoman, and board of directors for the major companies in\\nthe industry.\\nIf the founders of the companies are currently serving as CEO, chairman or chairwoman, or board member of their companies, it’s a good\\nindustry to enter. It is probably still young and vital, and there are\\nprobably still opportunities to exploit all over the place, either\\nat those companies or at new companies in that industry.\\nIf not — if the industry’s founders are dead, or old and out of\\ntouch — beware. That industry is now dominated by companies\\nthat are being run by second or third or even fourth generation managers who inherited their companies pre-built, and are\\nserving as caretakers.\\nIf you are young and want to have an impact, you want to be in\\nan industry where there is a lot of growth and change and Iux\\nand opportunity.\\nAs an industry ages, the vitality drains out until all that’s lea is a\\nset of ossiXed remnants in the form of oligopolostic entities of\\nwhich you would Xnd being a part to be completely soul-killing.\\nThe exception comes when an industry has gotten so old and\\nossiXed that the clear opportunity exists to up-end it and introduce a new order, a new way of doing things, and therefore a\\nnew set of companies.\\nIn some industries this happens routinely — e.g. every 10-20\\nyears. This is the case in technology, for example, and Xnancial\\nservices.\\nIt doesn’t seem to happen ever in certain other industries which\\nI won’t name for fear of being permanently cut oW from my\\nnecessary supply of oil, gas, music, and movies.\\nIf you’re going to enter an old industry, make sure to do it on\\nthe side of the forces of radical change that threaten to up-end\\nthe existing order — and make sure that those forces of change\\nhave a reasonable chance at succeeding.\\nSecond rule of thumb:\\nOnce you have picked an industry, get right to the center of it\\nas fast as you possibly can.\\nYour target is the core of change and opportunity — Xgure\\nout where the action is and head there, and do not delay your\\nprogress for extraneous opportunities, no matter how lucrative\\nthey might be.\\nNever worry about being a small Hsh in a big pond. Being a big\\nXsh in a small pond sucks — you will hit the ceiling on what you\\ncan achieve quickly, and nobody will care. Optimize at all times\\nfor being in the most dynamic and exciting pond you can Fnd. That is\\nwhere the great opportunities can be found.\\nApply this rule when selecting which company to go to. Go to\\nthe company where all the action is happening.\\nOr, if you are going to join a startup or start your own company,\\nalways make sure that your startup is aimed at the largest and\\nPart 3: Where to go and why 121\\nmost interesting opportunity available — the new markets that\\nare growing fast and changing rapidly.\\nAlso apply this rule when selecting which city to live in. Go to\\nthe city where all the action is happening.\\nFor technology, at least in the US, this is Silicon Valley. For\\nentertainment, this is Los Angeles. For politics, Washington DC.\\nFor coWee, Seattle. For Xnancial services, New York — unless\\nyou are convinced that there are equally compelling opportunities someplace else, like London or Hong Kong or Shanghai.\\nIn my opinion, living anywhere other than the center of your industry\\nis a mistake. A lot of people — those who don’t live in that place\\n— don’t want to hear it. But it’s true. Geographic locality is still\\n— even in the age of the Internet — critically important if you\\nwant to maximize your access to the best companies, the best\\npeople, and the best opportunities. You can always cite exceptions,\\nbut that’s what they are: exceptions.\\nNo one cares who the top Xlmmaker in Chicago is — hell, people oaen don’t even care who the top Xlmmaker in New York is,\\nand quite a lot of Xlms get made out of New York. On the other\\nhand, the top 50 Xlmmakers in Los Angeles are all very important people in their industry.\\nLet’s Yavor all of the above with a little nuance:\\n“Current importance” may not be the same as “greatest\\nchange”.\\nWhenever you believe that the currently dominant companies,\\nor cities, are not the places of greatest change and opportunity,\\nyou have a decision to make.\\nPerhaps New York, while clearly the Xnancial services capital of\\nthe world, is not the place of greatest opportunity for someone\\nnew. Perhaps, for you, that would be Dubai, or Buenos Aires, or\\nPrague, or Macau.\\nAnd perhaps Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers, Citigroup, and JP Morgan Chase, while clearly the most\\n122 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nimportant Xnancial services companies in the world, are not the\\ncompanies of greatest opportunity for someone new. Perhaps,\\nfor you, that’s a totally diWerent kind of Xnancial services company, like Paypal.\\nThen you have a decision to make — whether to tilt a little\\nconservative and stick with the currently most important place\\nand companies under the rationale that they are still the major\\nagents of change in the industry, or tilt aggressive and go someplace or to some Xrm that’s up and coming and might represent\\ndisruptive change and therefore even greater opportunity.\\nEither way, to quote Pink Floyd, “set the controls for the heart of\\nthe sun” — be sure you’re heading where the action is, where the\\nbiggest opportunities in your Xeld are, as you’ve chosen to think\\nabout it. Don’t fart around in second and third tier companies\\nthat don’t have a clear mission to dominate their markets.\\nThird rule:\\nIn a rapidly changing Held like technology, the best place to\\nget experience when you’re starting out is in younger, highgrowth companies.\\n(This is not necessarily true in older and more established\\nindustries, but those aren’t the industries we’re talking about.)\\nThere are a bunch of great things that you get when you go to\\na younger, high-growth company:\\n• You’ll get to do lots of stuE.There will be so much stuW to do in\\nthe company that you’ll be able to do as much of it as you\\ncan possibly handle. Which means you’ll gain skills and\\nexperience very quickly.\\n• You’ll probably get promoted quickly.Fast-growing companies are\\ncharacterized by a chronic lack of people who can step up to\\nall the important new leadership jobs that are being created\\nall the time. If you are aggressive and performing well,\\npromotions will come quickly and easily.\\n• You’ll get used to being in a high-energy, rapidly-changing\\nenvironment with sharp people and high expectations.It’s like\\nPart 3: Where to go and why 123\\ntraining for a marathon while wearing ankle weights — if you\\never end up going to a big company, you’ll blow everyone\\naway. And if you ever go to a startup, you’ll be ready for the\\nintensity.\\n• Reputational beneFt.Having Silicon Graphics from the early\\n90’s, or Netscape from the mid-90’s, or eBay from the late\\n90’s, or Paypal from the early 00’s, or Google from the\\nmid-00’s on your resume is as valuable as any advanced\\ndegree — it’s a permanent source of credibility.\\nIn contrast to going to a big company: working for a big company\\nteaches you how to work for big companies. The way things\\nwork at a big company is usually unique to big companies. So,\\nworking for a big company is oaen a statement that you plan\\nto spend your career at big companies — and lots of people are\\nvery happy doing that, but I doubt that’s your intention or you\\nwouldn’t be reading this post.\\nIn contrast to going to a startup: when you are Xrst starting your\\ncareer, you should realize that raw startups are highly variable in\\nterms of the experiences you will have. Some can be great, but\\nmany are very poorly managed and go nowhere. You will probably be better oW going somewhere that’s already succeeding,\\ngain skills and experience, and then go to a startup.\\nIn contrast to going to a mediocre small or mid-sized company that’s\\nnot growing: those are great places to go if you don’t want to go\\nanywhere yourself. If you Xnd yourself stuck in one, either Xgure out how to get the company unstuck and on a fast growth\\npath, or get yourself unstuck.\\nThere is a caveat to all this, which is as follows:\\nDon’t just be a “summertime soldier” — don’t go someplace\\nbecause it’s already successful, and then bail when things get\\ntough.\\nAny hiring manager for the rest of your career will be able to\\nread that on your resume just by looking at the dates.\\nHigh-growth companies virtually always hit speed bumps, or even huge\\n124 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\npotholes. StuW goes wrong. Going through the experience of gutting through the hard parts and coming out the other end will\\nbe a key part of your real-world education and will serve you\\nvery well down the road, especially if you ever start your own\\ncompany.\\nThen, once you’ve racked up killer skills and experiences at a\\nhigh-growth company, feel free to go to a startup.\\nPicking which startup to join probably deserves its own post.\\nHowever, in a nutshell, look for one where you understand the product, see how it might Ft into a very large market, and really like and\\nrespect the people who are already there.\\nOr, start your own company.\\nIf your startup fails, try another one. If that one fails, get back\\ninto a high-growth company to reset your resume and get more\\nskills and experiences. Then start another company. Repeat as\\nnecessary until you change the world.\\nFinally, every job you take and every role you Hll will always\\nbe a tactical opportunity and a strategic opportunity.\\nThe tactical opportunity is obvious: kick ass and take names —\\ngain skills and experiences that will be valuable to you in the\\nfuture, and do so well that everyone you work with is singing\\nyour praises for decades to come.\\nThe strategic opportunity is less obvious and oaen overlooked.\\nEvery job, every role, every company you go to is an opportunity to learn how a business works and how an industry works.\\nLearn everything you can about the business and the industry\\nin which you Xnd yourself.\\nThink strategically: how would I start a Xrm like this today? Or, if I\\nwere starting a company in this industry today, how would it be\\ndiWerent than this Xrm? Why is this Xrm and other Xrms in this\\nindustry doing what they do? What are the assumptions underneath their behavior? Should those assumptions be changing?\\nPart 3: Where to go and why 125\\nHow might this industry work diWerently? Which customers\\nare being underserved? What new technologies might change\\nthings completely? How were things working 10 years ago, versus today, versus 10 years from now? And, my favorite: if the\\ncreators of this industry were starting out today, what would\\nthey be doing now?\\nIn FX’s great new series Damages, a young attorney named Ellen\\nParsons has gone to work for a famous law Xrm called Hewes\\nand Associates, run by the legendary, ruthless, and amoral Patty\\nHewes. Ellen, rattled by the intensity of her experience at Hewes\\nand Associates, asks her mentor Hollis Nye what she should do:\\nHollis Nye: My advice to you, Ellen, is to stop trying to Xgure Patty\\nout. You’ll never change her, but she’ll change you.\\nEllen: How?\\nNye: By giving you access to how she thinks. You signed up for this;\\nnow, keep your head down, and do the work. That’s why you’re\\nthere, isn’t it?\\nEllen: Yes.\\nNye: Then don’t be shortsighted. Start using her. Learn everything\\nyou can, then get the hell out of there before it’s too late.\\nEllen: How exactly will I know when that is?\\nNye: Ah. That’s for another walk.\\n…and another post.\\n126 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nThe Pmarca Guide to Personal\\nProductivity\\nOne of my all-time favorite guilty pleasures is indulging in productivity porn.\\nProductivity porn (or, for those really in the know, “productivity\\npr0n”) consists of techniques, tactics, and tricks for maximizing\\npersonal productivity — or, as they say, “getting things done”.\\nHaving enjoyed such Xne purveyors of prodporn as Merlin\\nMann, Danny O’Brien, Gina Trapani, David Allen, and Tim Ferriss, I’d like to return the favor with the following: the Pmarca\\nGuide to Personal Productivity.\\nThe techniques that follow work together as an integrated set\\nfor me, but they probably won’t for you. Maybe you’ll get one or\\ntwo ideas — probably out of the ideas I stole from other people.\\nIf so, I have succeeded.\\nAnd here we go; let’s start with a bang:\\nDon’t keep a schedule\\nHe’s crazy, you say!\\nI’m totally serious. If you pull it oW — and in many structured\\njobs, you simply can’t — this simple tip alone can make a huge\\ndiWerence in productivity.\\nBy not keeping a schedule, I mean: refuse to commit to meetings, appointments, or activities at any set time in any future\\nday.\\nAs a result, you can always work on whatever is most important\\nor most interesting, at any time.\\nWant to spend all day writing a research report? Do it!\\nWant to spend all day coding? Do it!\\nWant to spend all day at the cafe down the street reading a book\\non personal productivity? Do it!\\nWhen someone emails or calls to say, “Let’s meet on Tuesday at\\n3″, the appropriate response is: “I’m not keeping a schedule for\\n2007, so I can’t commit to that, but give me a call on Tuesday at\\n2:45 and if I’m available, I’ll meet with you.”\\nOr, if it’s important, say, “You know what, let’s meet right now.”\\nClearly this only works if you can get away with it. If you have\\na structured job, a structured job environment, or you’re a CEO,\\nit will be hard to pull oW.\\nBut if you can do it, it’s really liberating, and will lead to far\\nhigher productivity than almost any other tactic you can try.\\nThis idea comes from a wonderful book called A Perfect Mess,\\nwhich explains how not keeping a schedule has been key to\\nArnold Schwarzenegger’s success as a movie star, politician, and\\nbusinessman over the last 20 years.\\nIf you have at any point in your life lived a relatively structured\\nexistence — probably due to some kind of job with regular oZce\\nhours, meetings, and the like — you will know that there is nothing more liberating than looking at your calendar and seeing\\nnothing but free time for weeks ahead to work on the most\\nimportant things in whatever order you want.\\nThis also gives you the best odds of maximizing Yow, which is a\\nwhole ‘nother topic but highly related.\\n128 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nI’ve been trying this tactic as an experiment in 2007, as those of\\nyou who have emailed me to suggest we get together or that I\\ngo to a conference or to a meeting will attest. And I am so much\\nhappier, I can’t even tell you. I get so much more time to focus\\non the things that really matter — in my case, my two companies, my nonproXt boards, and my lovely wife.\\nThe other great thing about this tactic is that it doesn’t have to\\nbe all or nothing — there are quite a few things that still sneak\\nonto my calendar that I really can’t get out of. But one is still\\nable to draw the line between “must do” and “sounds interesting\\nbut I’m not keeping a schedule”.\\nKeep three and only three lists: a Todo List,\\na Watch List, and a Later List.\\nThe more into lists you are, the more important this is.\\nInto the Todo List goes all the stuW you “must” do — commitments, obligations, things that have to be done. A single list, possibly subcategorized by timeframe (today, this week, next week,\\nnext month).\\nInto the Watch List goes all the stuW going on in your life that\\nyou have to follow up on, wait for someone else to get back to\\nyou on, remind yourself of in the future, or otherwise remember.\\nInto the Later List goes everything else — everything you might\\nwant to do or will do when you have time or wish you could do.\\nIf it doesn’t go on one of those three lists, it goes away.\\nEach night before you go to bed, prepare a\\n3×5 index card with a short list of 3 to 5\\nthings that you will do the next day.\\nAnd then, the next day, do those things.\\nI sit down at my desk before I go to sleep, pull up my Todo List\\nThe Pmarca Guide to Personal Productivity 129\\n(which I keep in Microsoa Word’s outline mode, due to long\\nhabit), and pick out the 3 to 5 things I am going to get done\\ntomorrow. I write those things on a fresh 3×5 card, lay the card\\nout with my card keys, and go to bed. Then, the next day, I try\\nlike hell to get just those things done. If I do, it was a successful\\nday.\\nPeople who have tried lots of productivity porn techniques will\\ntell you that this is one of the most successful techniques they\\nhave ever tried.\\nOnce you get into the habit, you start to realize how many days\\nyou used to have when you wouldn’t get 3 to 5 important/significant/meaningful things done during a day.\\nThen, throughout the rest of the day, use the back of the 3×5\\ncard as your Anti-Todo List.\\nThis isn’t a real list. And the name is tongue Xrmly in cheek.\\nWhat you do is this: every time you do something — anything\\n— useful during the day, write it down in your Anti-Todo List\\non the card.\\nEach time you do something, you get to write it down and you\\nget that little rush of endorphins that the mouse gets every time\\nhe presses the button in his cage and gets a food pellet.\\nAnd then at the end of the day, before you prepare tomorrow’s\\n3×5 card, take a look at today’s card and its Anti-Todo list and\\nmarvel at all the things you actually got done that day.\\nThen tear it up and throw it away.\\nAnother day well spent, and productive.\\nI love this technique — being able to put more notches on my\\naccomplishment belt, so to speak, by writing down things on my\\nAnti-Todo list as I accomplish them throughout the day makes\\nme feel marvelously productive and eZcient. Far more so than\\nif I just did those things and didn’t write them down.\\nPlus, you know those days when you’re running around all day\\n130 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nand doing stuW and talking to people and making calls and\\nresponding to emails and Xlling out paperwork and you get\\nhome and you’re completely exhausted and you say to yourself,\\n“What the hell did I actually get done today?”\\nYour Anti-Todo list has the answer.\\nBy the way, in order to do this, you have to carry a pen with\\nyou everywhere you go. I recommend the Fisher Space Pen.\\nIt’s short and bullet-shaped so it won’t poke you in the thigh\\nwhen it’s in your pocket, it’s wonderfully retro, it helped save\\nthe Apollo 11 mission, and it writes upside down. What’s not to\\nlike?\\nStructured procrastination\\nThis is a great one.\\nThis one is liaed straight from the genius mind of John Perry,\\na philosophy professor at Stanford. (Read his original description, by all means. You even get to see a photo of him practicing\\njumping rope with seaweed on a beach while work awaits. Outstanding.)\\nThe gist of Structured Procrastination is that you should never\\nXght the tendency to procrastinate — instead, you should use it\\nto your advantage in order to get other things done.\\nGenerally in the course of a day, there is something you have to\\ndo that you are not doing because you are procrastinating.\\nWhile you’re procrastinating, just do lots of other stuW instead.\\nAs John says, “The list of tasks one has in mind will be ordered\\nby importance. Tasks that seem most urgent and important are\\non top. But there are also worthwhile tasks to perform lower\\ndown on the list. Doing these tasks becomes a way of not doing\\nthe things higher up on the list. With this sort of appropriate\\ntask structure, the procrastinator becomes a useful citizen.\\nIndeed, the procrastinator can even acquire, as I have, a reputation for getting a lot done.”\\nThe Pmarca Guide to Personal Productivity 131\\nReading John’s essay was one of the single most profound\\nmoments of my entire life.\\nFor example, I hate making phone calls. Hate it. Love sending\\nemails, enjoy seeing people face to face (sometimes), but I hate\\nmaking phone calls.\\nI can get so much done while I am avoiding making a phone call\\nthat I need to make, I can barely believe it.\\nIn fact, that’s what’s happening right now.\\nThe other key two-word tactic…\\nStrategic incompetence\\nThe best way to to make sure that you are never asked to do\\nsomething again is to royally screw it up the Xrst time you are\\nasked to do it.\\nOr, better yet, just say you know you will royally screw it up —\\nmaintain a strong voice and a clear gaze, and you’ll probably get\\noW the hook.\\nOf course, this assumes that there are other things that are more\\nimportant at which you are competent.\\nWhich, hopefully, there are.\\nOrganizing the company picnic, sending faxes or Fedexes,\\nnegotiating with insurance brokers, writing in plain English…\\nthe list of things at which one can be strategically incompetent\\nis nearly endless.\\nDo email exactly twice a day\\n— say, once Xrst thing in the morning, and once at the end of\\nthe workday.\\nAllocated half an hour or whatever it takes, but otherwise, keep\\nyour email client shut and your email notiHcations turned oG.\\n132 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nAnyone who needs to reach you so urgently that it can’t wait\\nuntil later in the day or tomorrow morning can call you, or send\\na runner, or send up smoke signals, or something else.\\nOr, more likely, Xnd someone else who can do whatever it is that\\nneeds doing.\\n(If you communicate with your spouse or key family members\\nvia email during the day, then just set up a separate email\\naccount just for them and leave that open all day, but keep\\nyour primary email closed. And never give out the family email\\naddress to anyone noncritical — including your boss.)\\nOnly doing email twice a day will make you far more productive\\nfor the rest of the day.\\nThe problem with email is that getting an email triggers that\\nsame endorphin hit I mentioned above — the one that a mouse\\ngets when he bonks on the button in the cage and gets a food\\npellet.\\nResponding to an email triggers that same hit.\\nThe pleasure chemical hits your neocortex and you go “ahhh”\\ninside and feel like you’ve done something.\\nSo you sit and work with your mail client open and you interrupt your work every time an email comes in and you answer it\\nand you send another email and you feel great in the moment.\\nBut what you’re really doing is fracturing your time, interrupting your Yow, and killing your ability to focus on anything long\\nenough to get real high-quality work done.\\nThis one is far easier to say than do. And it won’t be feasible\\nduring projects where lots of updates during the day really are\\nimportant — raising money, for example, or closing a big deal.\\nMe, I’m just trying to get down to checking email only a half\\ndozen times per day.\\nThe Pmarca Guide to Personal Productivity 133\\nWhen you do process email, do it like this\\nFirst, always Hnish each of your two daily email sessions with a\\ncompletely empty inbox.\\nI don’t know about you, but when I know I have emails in my\\ninbox that haven’t been dealt with, I Xnd it hard to concentrate\\non other things.\\nThe urge to go back to my email is nearly overpowering.\\n(I am apparently seriously addicted to endorphins.)\\nSecond, when doing email, either answer or Hle every single\\nmessage until you get to that empty inbox state of grace.\\nNot keeping a schedule helps here, a lot, if you can pull it oW —\\nyou can reply to a lot of messages with “I’m sorry, I’m not keeping a schedule in 2007, I can’t commit to that.”\\nThird, emails relating to topics that are current working projects or pressing issues go into temporary subfolders of a\\nfolder called Action.\\nYou should only have Action subfolders for the things that really\\nmatter, right now.\\nThose subfolders then get used, and the messages in them\\nprocessed, when you are working on their respective projects in\\nthe normal course of your day.\\nFourth, aside from those temporary Action subfolders, only\\nkeep three standing email folders: Pending, Review, and Vault.\\nEmails that you know you’re going to have to deal with again —\\nsuch as emails in which someone is committing something to\\nyou and you want to be reminded to follow up on it if the person doesn’t deliver — go in Pending.\\nEmails with things you want to read in depth when you have\\nmore time, go into Review.\\nEverything else goes into Vault.\\n134 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nEvery once in a while, sweep through your Action subfolders\\nand dump any of them that you can into Vault.\\n(And do the same thing for messages in your Pending folder —\\nmost of the things in there you will never look at again. Actually,\\nsame is true for Review.)\\nThat’s it.\\nYou can get away with this because modern email clients are so\\ngood at search (well, most of them — and you can always move\\nto GMail) that it’s not worth the eWort to try to Xle emails into\\nlots of diWerent folders.\\nObviously you may need some additional permanent folders\\nfor important things like contracts, or emails from your doctor,\\nor the like, but these are exceptions and don’t change your standard operating procedure.\\nDon’t answer the phone\\nLet it go to voicemail, and then every few hours, screen your\\nvoicemails and batch the return calls.\\nSay, twice a day.\\nCell phones and family plans are so cheap these days that I think\\nthe best thing to do is have two cell phones with diWerent numbers — one for key family members, your closest friends, and\\nyour boss and a few coworkers, and the other for everyone else.\\nAnswer the Xrst one when it rings, but never answer the second\\none.\\nHide in an iPod\\nOne of the best and easiest ways to avoid distractions in the\\nworkplace is to be wearing those cute little IPod earbud headphones (or any other headphones of your choice).\\nThe Pmarca Guide to Personal Productivity 135\\nPeople, for some reason, feel much worse interrupting you if\\nyou are wearing headphones than if you’re not.\\nIt’s great — a lot of the time, people will walk up to you, start\\nto say something, notice the headphones, apologize (using exaggerated mouth motions), and walk away.\\nThis is great — half the time they didn’t actually need to talk to\\nyou, and the other half of the time they can send an email that\\nyou can process at the end of the day during the second of your\\ntwo daily email sweeps.\\nHere’s the best part: you don’t actually have to be listening to\\nanything.\\nHell, you don’t even have to have the headphones plugged into\\nanything.\\nSleeping and Eating\\nI’m not going to talk a lot about getting up early or going to\\nbed late or anything else related to the course of a typical day,\\nbecause everyone’s diWerent.\\nPersonally I go back and forth between being a night owl (99% of\\nthe time) and a morning person (1% — I’m going to try to push\\nit to 2%).\\nBut the thing that matters almost more than anything in determining whether I’ll have a happy, satisfying day is this: no matter what time you get up, start the day with a real, sit-down\\nbreakfast.\\nThis serves two purposes.\\nFirst, it fuels you up. Study aaer study have shown that breakfast\\nis, yes, the most important meal of the day. It’s critical to properly fuel the body for the day’s activities and it’s also critical to\\nstaying lean or losing weight. (People who don’t have breakfast\\ntend to eat more, and worse, at lunch.)\\nSecond, it gives you a chance to calmly, peacefully collect your\\n136 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nthoughts and prepare mentally and emotionally for the day\\nahead.\\nThis works whether you do it with kids and/or a partner, or\\nyou’re solo.\\nPersonally I think it’s worth whatever eWort is involved to go to\\nbed early enough to wake up early enough to have a good solid\\n45 minutes or an hour for breakfast each morning, if you can\\npull it oW.\\nOnly agree to new commitments when both\\nyour head and your heart say yes\\nThis one is from the great Robert Evans.

Next time\\nmy mobile wiki-based GTD Outlook synchronized hipster PDA\\nreminds me, I’ll check ‘em out.\\nNotes based on reader feedback:\\nTurns out Robert Benchley wrote about structured procrastination back in 1949. Wonderful essay — highly recommended.\\nThe sharpest reaction has been to my theory of not keeping a\\nschedule. I’ll stick to my theory but make (or re-make) a couple\\nof clarifying points.\\nFirst, it is certainly true that many people have jobs and responsibilities where they can’t do that. Or maybe can only do it partially. And many people enjoy living a highly structured life and\\nobviously this approach is not for them.\\nBut if your reaction is, “boy, I wish I could do that”, then it may\\nwell be worth rethinking your approach to your career.\\nI can tell you from personal experience that being stuck in a role\\nwhere you have a lot of structure but feel like you never get any138 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nthing done is not the optimal way to advance in one’s profession,\\nor maximize one’s job satisfaction.\\nSecond, I do not recommend pursuing this approach in one’s\\npersonal life :-).\\nOn another topic, the tactic of each night, write down the 3 to\\n5 things you need to do the next day has struck some people as\\ntoo simplistic.\\nThat may be the case for some people, but I can’t tell you how\\nmany times I’ve arrived home at night and am at a loss as to\\nwhat I actually got done that day, despite the fact that I worked\\nall day.\\nAnd I also can’t tell you how oaen I’ve had a huge, highly-structured todo list in front of me with 100 things on it and I stare\\nat it and am paralyzed into inaction (or, more likely, structured\\nprocrastination).\\nSo a day when I get 3 to 5 concrete, actionable things done in\\naddition to all the other stuW one has to do to get through the\\nday — well, that’s a good day.\\nA few people have said, why not just use GTD (David Allen’s\\n“Getting Things Done” approach).\\nWhile I Xnd GTD to be highly inspiring, in practice I think it’s\\nawfully complex. At least if your job is based on project work (as\\nopposed to having a highly structured role like CEO or head of\\nsales).\\nFor me, an organization system that requires signiXcant time to\\ndeal with in and of itself is not optimal. Much better, for me at\\nleast, is to focus on stripping away nonessentials and freeing up\\nas much time as possible to deal with whatever is most important.\\nFinally, I discovered aaer writing this post that Paul Graham talks a bit about the role of time and focus in personal productivity in his essay on “The Power of the Marginal”.\\nThe Pmarca Guide to Personal Productivity 139\\nThanks for all the comments!\\n140 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nPsychology and\\nEntrepreneurship\\nThe Psychology of Entrepreneurial\\nMisjudgment: Biases 1-6\\nCharlie Munger is an 80-something billionaire who cofounded\\ntop-tier law Xrm Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson and is Warren\\nBuffett’s long-time partner and Vice-Chairman at Berkshire\\nHathaway, one of the most successful companies of all time.\\nSome people, including me, consider Mr. Munger to be an even\\nmore interesting thinker and writer than Mr. BuWett, and\\nrecently a group of Mr. Munger’s friends assembled a compilation book of his most interesting thoughts and speeches\\ncalled Poor Charlie’s Almanack, inspired by Ben Franklin’s Poor\\nRichard’s Almanack. (The Munger book is only available on Amazon in used form, although you can apparently buy a new\\ncopy here.)\\nMr. Munger’s magnum opus speech, included in the book,\\nis The Psychology of Human Misjudgment — an exposition of 25\\nkey forms of human behavior that lead to misjudgment and\\nerror, derived from Mr. Munger’s 60 years of business experience. Think of it as a practitioner’s summary of human psychology and behavioral economics as observed in the real world.\\nIn this series of blog posts, I will walk through all 25 of the biases\\nMr. Munger identiXes, and then adapt them for the modern\\nentrepreneur. In each case I will start with relevant excerpts of\\nMr. Munger’s speech, and then aaer that add my own thoughts.\\nOne: Reward and Punishment\\nSuperresponse Tendency\\nI place this tendency Xrst in my discussion because almost everyone thinks he fully recognizes how important incentives and disincentives are in changing cognition and behavior. But this is not\\noaen so. For instance, I think I’ve been in the top Xve percent of\\nmy age cohort almost all my adult life in understanding the power\\nof incentives, and yet I’ve always underestimated that power. Never\\na year passes but I get some surprise that pushes a little further my\\nappreciation of incentive superpower.\\n…We [should] heed the general lesson implicit in the injunction of\\nBen Franklin in Poor Richard’s Almanack: “If you would persuade,\\nappeal to interest and not to reason.” This maxim is a wise guide\\nto a great and simple precaution in life: Never, ever, think about\\nsomething else when you should be thinking about the power of\\nincentives…\\nOne of the most important consequences of incentive superpower\\nis what I call “incentive caused bias.” A man has an acculturated\\nnature making him a pretty decent fellow, and yet, driven both\\nconsciously and subconsciously by incentives, he drias into\\nimmoral behavior in order to get what he wants, a result he facilitates by rationalizing his bad behavior [like a salesman who harms\\nher customers by selling them the wrong product because she gets\\npaid more for selling it, versus the right product — see, e.g., the\\nmutual fund industry].\\n…Another generalized consequence of incentive caused bias is that\\nman tends to “game” all human systems, oaen displaying great\\ningenuity in wrongly serving himself at the expense of others.\\nAntigaming features, therefore, constitute a huge and necessary\\npart of almost all system design.\\n…Military and naval organizations have very oaen been extreme\\nin using punishment [the inverse of reward] to change behavior,\\nprobably because they needed to cause extreme behavior. Around\\nthe time of Caesar, there was a European tribe that, when the\\nassembly horn blew, always killed the last warrior to reach his\\nassigned place, and no one enjoyed Xghting this tribe.\\nHuman response to incentives is indeed a huge behavioral\\nmotivator, and I think Mr. Munger is right that once you think\\nyou realize how big it is, you need to assume it’s even bigger.\\nThe Psychology of Entrepreneurial Misjudgment: Biases 1-6 143\\nThis is why stock options work so well in startups — and the\\nfewer people in a startup, the better stock options work, since\\nwhen there are only a few people in a company, it’s usually crystal clear to each person how her work will impact the value of\\nthe company.\\nThere is a wrong-headed and dangerous theory afoot that\\nrestricted stock (grants of fully in-the-money shares of stock) is\\na more appropriate motivator of employees of tech companies\\nthan stock options:\\nMr. Gates wanted Mr. BuWett’s input on whether to drop options in\\nfavor of restricted stock at Microsoa. [Gates] recalls asking: “How\\nwill employees respond to getting a lottery ticket that gives them a\\ndeXnite amount instead of one that could amount to nothing or a\\nridiculous sum?”\\nMr. BuWett’s reply, according to Mr. Gates, was: “My wife would\\nrather have a ticket for one fur coat, than a ticket that gave her two\\nor nothing.”\\nOvert sexism aside, from an incentive standpoint the result of\\nshiaing from stock options to restricted stock should be obvious: current employees will be incented to preserve value instead\\nof creating value. And new hires will by deXnition be people who\\nare conservative and change-averse, as the people who want\\nto swing for the fences and get rewarded for creating something new will go somewhere else, where they will receive stock\\noptions — in typically greater volume than anyone will ever\\ngrant restricted stock — and have greater upside.\\nAnd sure enough, in the wake of shiaing towards restricted\\nstock and away from stock options, Microsoa’s stock has been\\nYat as a pancake. The incentive works.\\nNow, against that, it is true that stock options, particularly for\\npublic companies, have an oaen-destructive random component: they tend to increase in value in rising stock market environments and decrease in value (potentially to zero) in falling\\nstock market environments, regardless of whether value is being\\ncreated inside your particular company.\\nFor that reason, in the long run it probably makes sense for\\n144 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nsome new approach to stock-based compensation to be developed that both preserves the motivation to create as opposed\\nto preserve value, but factors out the environmental swings of\\nrising and falling stock markets. Some form of indexing against\\nmarket averages would probably do the trick. This has been\\ntried from time to time, and I expect it to be tried more in the\\nfuture, at least for public companies.\\nAs a company grows, stock options and other forms of equitybased motivation become less and less useful as an incentive\\ntool, since it becomes harder for many employees in a large\\ncompany to see how their individual behavior would have any\\neWect on the stock price of the overall corporation. So, more tactical incentives kick in, such as cash bonuses.\\nThe design of tactical incentives — e.g. bonuses — is a whole\\ntopic in and of itself, and is critically important as your company grows. The most signiXcant thing to keep in mind is that\\nhow the goals are designed really matters — as Mr. Munger says,\\npeople tend to game any system you put in place, and then they\\ntend to rationalize that gaming until they believe they really are\\ndoing the right thing.\\nI think it was Andy Grove who said that for every goal you put in\\nfront of someone, you should also put in place a counter-goal to restrict\\ngaming of the Frst goal.\\nSo, for example, if you are incenting your recruiters on the\\nnumber of new employees recruited and hired, you need to\\nalso give them a counter-goal (and tie it to their compensation)\\nthat measures the quality of the new hires three months in.\\nOtherwise the recruiters are guaranteed to give you what\\nyou don’t want: a lot of mediocre new hires.\\nOne of the great unwritten Silicon Valley skewed incentive stories was a major datacenter vendor in the late 90’s that incented\\nits salespeople based on bookings of long-term datacenter leases,\\nwithout suZcient counter-goals tied to revenue collection or\\nthe customer’s ability to pay. Sure enough, soon the company’s\\nreported bookings were heading straight up, revenue was Yat,\\nand cash headed straight down, resulting in a truly spectacular\\nThe Psychology of Entrepreneurial Misjudgment: Biases 1-6 145\\nbankruptcy. The salespeople got paid, though, so they were\\nhappy.\\nMore recently, skewed incentives in the mortgage industry —\\nmortage issuers getting paid based on quantity of mortgages\\nissued, versus ability to pay — caused many of the current catastrophic Wall Street Xnancial meltdowns you get to read about\\nevery day.\\nEven engineers need counter-goals: incent engineers based\\npurely on a ship date, and you’ll get a shipping product with lots\\nof bugs. Incent based on number of bugs Xxed, and you’ll never\\nget any new features. And so on.\\nEspecially in smaller companies, peer pressure can be a very\\neWective form of incentive. This is greatly enabled and abetted\\nby transparency. People hate to be embarrassed in front of their\\npeer group, so if it’s crystal clear who’s performing well and who\\nisn’t, poor performers will be highly motivated to improve —\\nand if they’re not, that’s good to know, since obviously then you\\nreally need to Xre them.\\nFinally, any entrepreneur should be highly attuned to incentives\\nwhen hiring outside executives, especially a CEO. Hire a CEO\\nand give her a large stock-option grant with four-year vesting,\\nand you can guarantee she will sell the company in year four.\\nGive her a stock-option grant with accelerated vesting on\\nchange of control and she will sell the company sooner than\\nthat. Founders can get tripped up on this because they naturally\\nhave an emotional incentive to see the company succeed that\\nhired executives oaen do not share.\\nAnd of course, never get caught between a venture capitalist and\\nher incentives.\\nTwo: Liking/Loving Tendency\\n…[W]hat will a man naturally come to like and love, apart from his\\nparent, spouse and child? Well, he will like and love being liked and\\nloved… [M]an will generally strive, lifelong, for the aWection and\\napproval of many people not related to him.\\n146 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nOne very practical consequence of Liking/Loving Tendency is that\\nit acts as a conditioning device that makes the liker or lover tend\\n(1) to ignore faults of, and comply with wishes of, the object of his\\naWection, (2) to favor people, products, and actions merely associated with the object of his aWection (as we shall see when we get\\nto “InYuence-from-Mere-Association Tendency”), and (3) to distort\\nother facts to facilitate love.\\nThe application of this principle to entrepreneurs is obvious:\\nentrepreneurs want to be liked just like everyone else, and wanting to be liked can be a major impediment to entrepreneurial\\nsuccess due to at least two major reasons.\\nFirst, an entrepreneur, like any CEO, has to make tough decisions about what her company will do, and those decisions will\\noaen run counter to the preferences of her employees. You\\ndon’t have to be involved in that many startups to Xnd one\\nwhere the entrepreneur knows she needs to make a tough decision — such as change strategy, or cancel a Yawed project — but\\ncan’t quite do it because employees won’t like it. Of course this\\nalways backXres: employees also don’t like leaders who don’t\\nmake the tough decisions that have to be made.\\nSecond, an entrepreneur, like any manager, has to Xre people\\nwho aren’t great or who aren’t right for the tasks at hand. This\\nnaturally makes people not like you, particularly the people you\\nXre. But again, not doing this backXres: nobody great wants to\\nbe in a company populated by mediocre or ill-Xtting peers.\\nI think these pressures are intensiXed in a small company versus\\na larger company, because in a small company everyone tends\\nto know everyone else and people naturally form strong personal relationships within the group — so the desire to be liked\\nis stronger, and the perceived risk from making decisions that\\npeople won’t like is higher.\\nA speciXc form of this dynamic in a startup is when you have\\nmultiple founders, of whom one is the CEO. The founder who\\nis the CEO inevitably discovers that it becomes very hard to stay\\nclose personal friends with the other founders. As they say, it’s\\nlonely at the top — if you’re doing your job right.\\nThe Psychology of Entrepreneurial Misjudgment: Biases 1-6 147\\nFinally, some entrepreneurs have emotional resistance to pursuing a strategy that does not meet with immediate approval\\nfrom press, analysts, and other entrepreneurs. This is worth\\nwatching carefully — if everyone agrees right up front that\\nwhatever you are doing makes total sense, it probably isn’t a new\\nand radical enough idea to justify a new company.\\nThree: Disliking/Hating Tendency\\nIn a pattern obverse to Liking/Loving Tendency, the newly arrived\\nhuman is also “born to dislike and hate” as triggered by normal and\\nabnormal triggering forces in its life…\\nAs a result, the long history of man contains almost continuous\\nwar…\\nDisliking/Hating Tendency also acts as a conditioning device that\\nmakes the disliker/hater tend to (1) ignore virtues in the object of\\ndislike, (2) dislike people, products, and actions merely associated\\nwith the object of his dislike, and (3) distort other facts to facilitate\\nhatred.\\nIf this is a problem inside your company, then you have bigger\\nissues than I can help you with.\\nHowever, I think this dynamic kicks in for a startup when thinking about competitors.\\nI see two destructive consequences of this bias in startups with\\ncompetitors:\\nFirst, I believe startups oaen overfocus on their competitors. It’s\\nthe easiest thing in the world to orient yourself in opposition to\\nanother company in the same market, and to plan your actions\\nbased on what will cause damage to the competitor or block the\\ncompetitor from getting business.\\nIn the startup world, that oaen leads to multiple competitors\\nengaged in a shooting war in a market that’s still too small for\\nanyone to succeed.\\nI think it’s much better for a startup to focus on creating and\\n148 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\ndeveloping a large market, as opposed to Xghting over a small\\nmarket.\\nSo when your startup’s competitive juices get Yowing — especially for the Xrst time — and you Xnd yourself Xxated on a\\ncompetitor, be sure to take a step back and say, is this really\\nwhat we want to be focused on right now — is the market we’re\\nboth in really large enough to warrant this? If so, sure, go for it,\\nguns blazing. But if not, stepping back and thinking about how\\nto focus instead on creating a large market might be more valuable.\\nA variant on this dynamic is letting your competitor determine\\nyour strategy by watching what he does and then making countermoves. The issue here is that it’s highly likely that neither\\none of you actually knows that much about what you are doing\\nyet — since you are in a new market, by deXnition — and while\\nyou know you don’t know that much about what you’re doing\\nyet, you only observe your competitors’s deliberate actions as\\nopposed to seeing their equivalent or greater level of internal\\nconfusion. So they seem like they know what they’re doing, and\\nso you fall into assuming they know more than you do, when\\nthey probably don’t.\\nSecond, when you are in a truly competitive situation, this bias\\ncan easily lead you to underestimate your competitor by, as Mr.\\nMunger says, “ignoring virtues in the object of dislike”.\\nHis product sucks, his salespeople aren’t as good, his venture\\ncapitalists are those morons who backed that large datacenter\\nvendor that went bankrupt — and so on.\\nNotably, this attitude can become cultural in your company\\nvery quickly. I think that if you’re in a shooting war, even if you\\nprivately think your competitor is an amoral pinhead, that you\\nestablish a tone that says, we’ll assume that he’s highly competent and has many Xne virtues, which we will respect and then\\nsystematically target with our own strengths and virtues until we\\nhave killed him.\\nThe Psychology of Entrepreneurial Misjudgment: Biases 1-6 149\\nFour: Doubt-Avoidance Tendency\\nThe brain of man is programmed with a tendency to quickly\\nremove doubt by reaching some decision.\\nIt is easy to see how evolution would make animals, over the eons,\\ndria toward such quick elimination of doubt. Aaer all, the one\\nthing that is surely counterproductive for a prey animal that is\\nthreatened by a predator is to take a long time in deciding what to\\ndo…\\nSo pronounced is the tendency in man to quickly remove doubt\\nby reaching some decision that behavior to counter the tendency is\\nrequired from judges and jurors. Here, delay before decision making is forced. And one is required to so comport himself, prior to\\nconclusion time, so that he is wearing a “mask” of objectivity. And\\nthe “mask” works to help real objectivity along, as we shall see when\\nwe next consider man’s Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency…\\nWhat triggers Doubt-Avoidance Tendency? Well, an unthreatened\\nman, thinking of nothing in particular, is not being prompted to\\nremove doubt through rushing to some decision. As we shall see\\nlater when we get to Social-Proof Tendency and Stress-InYuence\\nTendency, what usually triggers Doubt-Avoidance Tendency is\\nsome combination of (1) puzzlement and (2) stress.\\nThis is probably a good one for entrepreneurs. You’d better not\\nhave a lot of doubts about what you are doing because everyone\\nelse will, and if you do too, you’ll probably give up.\\nOf course, an entrepreneur’s doubt avoidance is only a plus\\nright up to the point where it becomes pigheaded stubbornness\\nthat interferes with her ability to see reality, particularly when a\\nstrategy is not working.\\nIn my view, entrepreneurial judgment is the ability to tell the\\ndiWerence between a situation that’s not working but persistence\\nand iteration will ultimately prove it out, versus a situation that’s\\nnot working and additional eWort is a destructive waste of time\\nand radical change is necessary.\\nI don’t believe there are any good rules for being able to tell the\\ndiWerence between the two. Which is one of the main reasons\\nstarting a company is so hard.\\n150 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nFive: Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency\\n[People are] reluctant to change, which is a form of inconsistency\\navoidance. We see this in all human habits, constructive and\\ndestructive. Few people can list a lot of bad habits that they have\\neliminated, and some people cannot identify even one of these.\\nInstead, practically every one has a great many bad habits he has\\nlong maintained despite their being known as bad. Given this situation, it is not too much in many cases to appraise early-formed\\nhabits as destiny. When Marley’s miserable ghost says, “I wear the\\nchains I forged in life,” he is talking about chains of habit that were\\ntoo light to be felt before they became too strong to be broken.\\n[T]ending to be maintained in place by the anti-change tendency\\nof the brain are one’s previous conclusions, human loyalties, reputational identity, commitments…\\nIt is easy to see that a quickly reached conclusion, triggered by\\nDoubt-Avoidance Tendency, when combined with a tendency to\\nresist any change in that conclusion, will naturally cause a lot of\\nerrors in cognition for modern man. And so it observably works\\nout. We all deal much with others whom we correctly diagnose\\nas imprisoned in poor conclusions that are maintained by mental\\nhabits they formed early and will carry to their graves…\\nAnd so, people tend to accumulate large mental holdings of Xxed\\nconclusions and attitudes that are not oaen reexamined or\\nchanged, even though there is plenty of good evidence that they\\nare wrong…\\nAs Lord Keynes pointed out about his exalted intellectual group at\\none of the greatest universities in the world, it was not the intrinsic\\ndiZculty of new ideas that prevented their acceptance. Instead, the\\nnew ideas were not accepted because they were inconsistent with\\nold ideas in place…\\nWe have no less an authority for this than Max Planck, Nobel laureate, Xnder of “Planck’s constant.” Planck is famous not only for\\nhis science but also for saying that even in physics the radically\\nnew ideas are seldom really accepted by the old guard.

However,\\noaen you get a level of resistance from the market that can be\\npuzzling — “can’t they see that our new product would be better\\nfor them than what they have now?”\\nThis in turn leads to the odd dynamic you oaen see where a\\nstartup will Xeld a new product, nobody wants it, and the startup\\ngoes belly up.

As far as I’m aware, all we have are anecdotes.\\nHowever, a professor of psychology at University of California\\nDavis named Dean Simonton has conducted extensive research\\non age and creativity across many other Xelds, including science, literature, music, chess, Xlm, politics, and military combat.\\nDr. Simonton’s research is unparalleled — he’s spent his career\\nstudying this and related topics and his papers make for\\nabsolutely fascinating reading.\\nFor this post, I’ll be concentrating on his paper Age and Outstanding Achievement: What Do We Know Aaer a Century of\\nResearch? from 1988. I haven’t been able to Xnd a PDF of the\\npaper online but you can read a largely intact cached HTML\\nversion courtesy of Google Scholar.\\nLet’s go to the paper:\\nFor centuries, thinkers have speculated about the association\\nbetween a person’s age and exceptional accomplishment: Is there\\nan optimal age for a person to make a lasting contribution to\\nhuman culture or society? When during the life span can we expect\\nan individual to be most proliXc or inYuential?\\nYou can see why I think this is relevant.\\nHere we adopt the product-centered approach, that is, our focus\\nis on real-life achievements rather than performance on abstract…\\nmeasures. …\\n[A]chievement [takes] the form of noteworthy creativity… the goal\\nis to assess how productivity changes over the life span… [I] focus\\non individual accomplishment in such endeavors as science, philosophy, literature, music, and the visual arts. …\\n[Studies like these focus] on three core topics: (a) the age curve that\\nspeciXes how creative output varies over the course of a career, (b)\\nthe connection between productive precocity, longevity, and rate\\nof output, and (c) the relation between quantity and quality of output (i.e., between “productivity” and “creativity”).\\nDr. Simonton also discusses leadership as distinct from creative\\nproduction, but I’m ignoring the leadership part for now since\\nit’s quite diWerent.\\nOne empirical generalization appears to be fairly secure: If one\\nplots creative output as a function of age, productivity tends to rise\\nfairly rapidly to a deXnite peak and thereaaer decline gradually\\nuntil output is about half the rate at the peak.\\nThis is the centerpiece of Dr. Simonton’s overall theory across\\nmany domains. And is probably not unexpected. But here’s\\nwhere it gets really interesting:\\n[T]he location of the peak, as well as the magnitude of the postpeak\\ndecline, tends to vary depending on the domain of creative\\nachievement.\\nAt one extreme, some Xelds are characterized by relatively early\\npeaks, usually around the early 30s or even late 20s in chronological units, with somewhat steep descents thereaaer, so that the output rate becomes less than one-quarter the maximum. This ageAge and the Entrepreneur: Some data 155\\nwise pattern apparently holds for such endeavors as lyric poetry,\\npure mathematics, and theoretical physics…\\nThe typical trends in other endeavors may display a leisurely rise\\nto a comparatively late peak, in the late 40s or even 50s chronologically, with a minimal if not largely absent drop-oW aaerward. This\\nmore elongated curve holds for such domains as novel writing, history, philosophy, medicine, and general scholarship.\\nWell, that’s interesting.\\nIt must be stressed that these interdisciplinary contrasts do not\\nappear to be arbitrary but instead have been shown to be invariant\\nacross diWerent cultures and distinct historical periods.\\nAs a case in point, the gap between the expected peaks for poets\\nand prose authors has been found in every major literary tradition\\nthroughout the world and for both living and dead languages.\\nIndeed, because an earlier productive optimum means that a writer\\ncan die younger without loss to his or her ultimate reputation,\\npoets exhibit a life expectancy, across the globe and through history, about a half dozen years less than prose writers do.\\nYou know what that means — if you’re going to argue that\\nyounger entrepreneurs have a leg up, then you also have to\\nargue that they will have shorter lifespans. Fun with math!\\nYou may not be surprised to Xnd that in creative Xelds, the\\npower law rule — also known as the 80/20 rule — deXnitely\\napplies:\\nA small percentage of the workers in any given domain is responsible for the bulk of the work. Generally, the top 10% of the most\\nproliXc elite can be credited with around 50% of all contributions,\\nwhereas the bottom 50% of the least productive workers can claim\\nonly 15% of the total work, and the most productive contributor is\\nusually about 100 times more proliXc than the least.\\nHere’s where it gets really interesting again:\\nPrecocity, longevity, and output rate are each strongly associated\\nwith Xnal lifetime output — that is, those who generate the most\\ncontributions at the end of a career also tend to have begun their\\ncareers at earlier ages, ended their careers at later ages, and produced at extraordinary rates throughout their careers. …\\n156 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nThese three components are conspicuously linked with each other:\\nThose who are precocious also tend to display longevity, and both\\nprecocity and longevity are positively associated with high output\\nrates per age unit.\\nOK, so on to the main question, which is, when’s the peak?\\nThose creators who make the most contributions tend to start\\nearly, end late, and produce at above-average rates, but are the\\nanticipated career peaks unchanged, earlier, or later in comparison\\nto what is seen for their less proliXc colleagues? Addressing this\\nquestion properly requires that we Xrst investigate the relation\\nbetween quantity and quality, both within and across careers. …\\nThis is a very complex topic and Dr. Simonton goes into great\\ndetail about it throughout his work. I’m going to gloss over it a\\nbit, but if you are interested in this topic, by all means dig into it\\nmore via Google Scholar.\\nFirst, if one calculates the age curves separately for major and\\nminor works within careers, the resulting functions are basically\\nidentical…\\nSecond… minor and major contributions… Yuctuate together.\\nThose periods in a creator’s life that see the most masterpieces also\\nwitness the greatest number of easily forgotten productions, on the\\naverage.\\nAnother way of saying the same thing is to note that the “quality\\nratio,” or the proportion of major products to total output per age\\nunit, tends to Yuctuate randomly over the course of any career. The\\nquality ratio neither increases nor decreases with age…\\nThese outcomes are valid for both artistic and scientiXc modes of\\ncreative contribution. What these two results signify is that… age\\nbecomes irrelevant to determining the success of a particular contribution.\\nOK, that’s interesting. Quality of output does not vary by age…\\nwhich means, of course, that attempting to improve your batting average of hits versus misses is a waste of time as you\\nprogress through a creative career. Instead you should just focus\\non more at-bats — more output. Think about that one.\\nIf this sounds insane to you, Dr. Simonton points out that the\\nperiods of Beethoven’s career that had the most hits also had the\\nAge and the Entrepreneur: Some data 157\\nmost misses — works that you never hear. As I am always fond\\nof asking in such circumstances, if Beethoven couldn’t increase\\nhis batting average over time, what makes you think you can?\\n[C]reativity is a probabilistic consequence of productivity, a relationship that holds both within and across careers.\\nWithin single careers, the count of major works per age period\\nwill be a positive function of total works generated each period,\\nyielding a quality ratio that exhibits no systematic developmental\\ntrends.\\nAnd across careers, those individual creators who are the most productive will also tend, on the average, to be the most creative: Individual variation in quantity is positively associated with variation\\nin quality.\\nWow.\\nOK, next step:\\n[This] constant-probability-of-success model has an important\\nimplication for helping us understand the relation between total\\nlifetime output and the location of the peak age for creative\\nachievement within a single career.\\nBecause total lifetime output is positively related to total creative\\ncontributions and hence to ultimate eminence, and given that a\\ncreator’s most distinguished work will appear in those career periods when productivity is highest, the peak age for creative impact\\nshould not vary as a function of either the success of the particular\\ncontribution or the Xnal fame of the creator. …\\nThus, even though an impressive lifetime output of works, and\\nsubsequent distinction, is tied to precocity, longevity, and production rate, the expected age optimum for quantity and quality of\\ncontribution is dependent solely on the particular form of creative\\nexpression.\\nWow, again.\\nAnyone who demonstrates… an age decrement in achievement is\\nlikely to provoke controversy. Aaer all, aging is a phenomenon easy\\nenough to become defensive about, and such defensiveness is especially probable among those of us who are already past the putative\\nage peak for our particular Xeld of endeavor…\\n158 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nI think Dr. Simonton is ready to start blogging.\\nHis paper then goes on to discuss many possible extrinsic factors such as health that could impair later-life output, but in the\\nend he concludes that the data is pretty conclusive that such\\nextrinsinc factors serve as “random shocks” to any individual’s\\ncareer that do not aWect the overall trends.\\nHe then goes on to discuss possible intrinsic factors that could\\nexplain a relationship between age and creative accomplishment:\\nG. M. Beard was not merely the earliest contributor [in 1874] to the\\nempirical literature on age and achievement but its Xrst theorist as\\nwell. According to him, creativity is a function of two underlying\\nfactors, enthusiasm and experience. Enthusiasm provides the\\nmotivational force behind persistent eWort, yet enthusiasm in the\\nabsence of the second factor yields just original work. Experience\\ngives the achiever the ability to separate wheat from chaW and to\\nexpress original ideas in a more intelligible and persistent fashion.\\nYet experience in the absence of enthusiasm produces merely routine contributions. Genuine creativity requires the balanced cooperation of both enthusiasm and experience.\\nBeard postulates, however, that these two essential components\\ndisplay quite distinctive distributions across the life span. Whereas\\nenthusiasm usually peaks early in life and steadily declines thereaaer, experience gradually increases as a positive monotonic function of age. The correct equilibrium between the two factors is\\nattained between the ages of 38 and 40, the most common age\\noptima for creative endeavors. Prior to that expected peak, an individual’s output would be excessively original, and in the postpeak\\nphase the output would be overly routine. The career Yoruit in the\\nlate 30s thus represents the uniquely balanced juxtaposition of the\\nrhapsodies of youth and the wisdom of maturity.\\nHmmmmmm…\\nBeard’s theory is not without attractive features… Beard’s account,\\nfor all its simplicity, can boast a respectable amount of explanatory\\npower. Besides handling the broad form of the age curve, this theory leads to an interpretation of why diWerent endeavors may peak\\nat distinct ages.\\nThe contrast between poetic and prose literature, for instance, can\\nbe interpreted as the immediate consequence of the assumption\\nAge and the Entrepreneur: Some data 159\\nthat the two domains demand a diWerent mix of the two factors:\\npoetry, more enthusiasm, and prose, more experience. Indeed, in\\nXelds in which expertise may be far more crucial than emotional\\nvigor, most notably in scholarship, we would anticipate little if any\\ndecline with age, and such is the case.\\nDr. Simonton, however, then goes on to explain that this theory\\ndoes not really match the data — for example, the data shows\\nthat quality of output in practically all Xelds does not decline\\nsystematically with age, which is what you’d expect from Beard’s\\ntheory.\\nThe paper then digs into possible correlations between intelligence as measured by such metrics as IQ, and creative output:\\n[E]ven if a minimal level of intelligence is requisite for achievement, beyond a threshold of around IQ 120 (the actual amount\\nvarying across Xelds), intellectual prowess becomes largely irrelevant in predicting individual diWerences in… creativity.\\nSo what have we learned in a nutshell?\\nGenerally, productivity — output — rises rapidly from the start\\nof a career to a peak and then declines gradually until retirement.\\n• This peak in productivity varies by Xeld, from the late 20s to\\nthe early 50s, for reasons that are Xeld-speciXc.\\n• Precocity, longevity, and output rate are linked. “Those who\\nare precocious also tend to display longevity, and both\\nprecocity and longevity are positively associated with high\\noutput rates per age unit.” High producers produce highly,\\nsystematically, over time.\\n• The odds of a hit versus a miss do not increase over time.\\nThe periods of one’s career with the most hits will also have\\nthe most misses. So maximizing quantity — taking more\\nswings at the bat — is much higher payoW than trying to\\nimprove one’s batting average.\\n• Intelligence, at least as measured by metrics such as IQ, is\\nlargely irrelevant.\\n160 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nSo here’s my Xrst challenge: to anyone who has an opinion on\\nthe role of age and entrepreneurship — see if you can Xt your\\nopinion into this model!\\nAnd here’s my second challenge: is entrepreneurship more like\\npoetry, pure mathematics, and theoretical physics — which\\nexhibit a peak age in one’s late 20s or early 30s — or novel writing, history, philosophy, medicine, and general scholarship —\\nwhich exhibit a peak age in one’s late 40s or early 50s? And how,\\nand why?\\nAge and the Entrepreneur: Some data 161\\nLuck and the entrepreneur: The\\nfour kinds of luck\\nIn the last few weeks, I’ve been reading huge stacks of books on\\nthe psychology of creativity and motivation — which is the reason for the relative scarcity of substantive blog posts. Said post\\nsituation will be remedied shortly, by a series of posts on — surprise! — the psychology of creativity and motivation.\\nBut Xrst, to complement my post on age and the entrepreneur from a few days ago, this post begins a series of occasional\\nposts about luck and the entrepreneur.\\nLuck is something that every successful entrepreneur will tell\\nyou plays a huge role in the diWerence between success and failure. Many of those successful entrepreneurs will only admit this\\nunder duress, though, because if luck does indeed play such a\\nhuge role, then that seriously dents the image of the successful\\nentrepreneur as an omniscient business genius.\\nMoreover, some of those people would shrug and say that luck\\nis simply out of your hands. Sometimes you have it, sometimes\\nyou don’t. But perhaps there’s more to it than that.\\nDr. James Austin, a neurologist and philosopher (!), wrote an\\noutstanding book called Chase, Chance, and Creativity — originally in 1978, then updated in 2003. It’s the best book I’ve read\\non the role of luck, chance, and serendipity in medical research\\n— or, for that matter, any creative endeavor. And because he’s a\\nneurologist, he has a grounding in how the brain actually exerts\\nitself creatively — although there is more recent research on\\nthat topic that is even more illuminating (more on that later).\\nIn the book, Dr. Austin outlines his theory of the four kinds of\\nluck — or, as he calls it, chance; I will use the terms interchangeably.\\nFirst, he deXnes chance as follows:\\nChance… something fortuitous that happens unpredictably without\\ndiscernable human intention.\\nYup, that’s luck.\\nChance is unintentional, it is capricious, but we needn’t conclude\\nthat chance is immune from human interventions. However, one\\nmust be careful not to read any unconsciously purposeful intent\\ninto “interventions”… [which] are to be viewed as accidental,\\nunwilled, inadvertent, and unforseeable.\\nIndeed, chance plays several distinct roles when humans react creatively with one another and with their environment…\\nWe can observe chance arriving in four major forms and for four\\ndiWerent reasons. The principles involved aWect everyone.\\nHere’s where it helps to be a neurologist writing on this topic:\\nThe four kinds of chance each have a diWerent kind of motor\\nexploratory activity and a diWerent kind of sensory receptivity.\\nThe [four] varieties of chance also involve distinctive personality\\ntraits and diWer in the way one particular individual inYuences\\nthem.\\nOK, so what are they?\\nIn Chance I, the good luck that occurs is completely accidental. It is\\npure blind luck that comes with no eWort on our part.\\nYup.\\nIn Chance II, something else has been added — motion.\\nYears ago, when I was rushing around in the laboratory [conducting\\nLuck and the entrepreneur: The four kinds of luck 163\\nmedical research], someone admonished me by asking, “Why all\\nthe busyness? One must distinguish between motion and progress”.\\nYes, at some point this distinction must be made. But it cannot\\nalways be made Xrst. And it is not always made consciously.\\nTrue, waste motion should be avoided. But, if the researcher did\\nnot move until he was certain of progress he would accomplish\\nvery little…\\nA certain [basic] level of action “stirs up the pot”, brings in random\\nideas that will collide and stick together in fresh combinations, lets\\nchance operate.\\nMotion yields a network of new experiences which, like a sieve, Xlter best when in constant up-and-down, side-to-side movement…\\nUnluck runs out if you keep stirring up things so that random elements can combine, by virtue of you and their inherent aZnities.\\nSounds like a startup!\\nChance II springs from your energetic, generalized motor activities… the freer they are, the better.\\n[Chance II] involves the kind of luck [Charles] Kettering… had in\\nmind when he said, “Keep on going and chances are you will stumble on something, perhaps when you are least expecting it. I have\\nnever heard of anyone stumbling on something sitting down.”\\nOK, now here’s where it gets interesting:\\nNow, as we move on to Chance III, we see blind luck, but it tiptoes\\nin soaly, dressed in camouYage.\\nChance presents only a faint clue, the potential opportunity exists,\\nbut it will be overlooked except by that one person uniquely\\nequipped to observe it, visualize it conceptually, and fully grasp its\\nsigniXcance.\\nChance III involves involves a special receptivity, discernment, and\\nintuitive grasp of signiXcance unique to one particular recipient.\\nLouis Pasteur characterized it for all time when he said, “Chance\\nfavors the prepared mind.”\\nI thought that was Eric Bogosian in Under Siege 2: Dark Territory, but OK.\\n…The classic example of [Chance III] occured in 1928, when Sir\\n164 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nAlexander Fleming’s mind instantly fused at least Xve elements\\ninto a conceptually uniXed nexus [when he discovered penicillin —\\none of the most important medical breakthroughs ever].\\nHe was at his work bench in the laboratory, made an observation,\\nand his mental sequences then went something like this: (a) I see\\nthat a mold has fallen by accident into my culture dish; (2) the\\nstaphylococcal colonies residing near it failed to grow; (3) therefore, the mold must have secreted something that killed the bacteria; (4) this reminds me of a similar experience I had once before;\\n(5) maybe this new “something” from the mold could be used to kill\\nstaphylococci that cause human infections.\\nActually, Fleming’s mind was exceptionally well prepared. Some\\nnine years earlier, while suWering from a cold [you can’t make\\nthis stuW up], his own nasal drippings had found their way onto a\\nculture dish. He noted that the bacteria around his mucous were\\nkilled, and astutely followed up the lead. His experiments then\\nled him to discover… lysozyme… [which] proved inappropriate for\\nmedical use, but think of how receptive Fleming’s mind was to the\\npenicillin mold when it later happened on the scene!\\nOK, what about Chance IV?\\n[Chance IV] favors the individualized action.\\nThis is the fourth element in good luck — an active, but unintentional, subtle individualized prompting of it.\\nPlease explain!\\nChance IV is the kind of luck that develops during a probing action\\nwhich has a distinctive personal Yavor.\\nThe English Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, summed up the\\nprinciple underlying Chance IV when he noted: “We make our fortunes and we call them fate.”\\nChance IV comes to you, unsought, because of who you are and\\nhow you behave.\\n…Chance IV is so personal, it is not easily understood by someone\\nelse the Xrst time around… here we probe into the subterranean\\nrecesses of personal hobbies and behavioral quirks that autobiographers know about, biographers rarely.\\n[In neurological terms], Chance III [is] concerned with personal sensory receptivity; its counterpart, Chance IV, [is] involved\\nwith personal motor behavior.\\nLuck and the entrepreneur: The four kinds of luck 165\\nPlease continue!\\n[You] have to look carefully to Xnd Chance IV for three reasons.\\nThe Xrst is that when it operates directly, it unfolds in an elliptical,\\nunorthodox manner.\\nThe second is that it oaen works indirectly.\\nThe third is that some problems it may help solve are uncommonly\\ndiZcult to understand because they have gone through a process of\\nselection.\\nWe must bear in mind that, by the time Chance IV Xnally occurs,\\nthe easy, more accessible problems will already have been solved\\nearlier by conventional actions, conventional logic, or by the operations of the other forms of chance. What remains late in the game,\\nthen, is a tough core of complex, resistant problems. Such problems yield to none but an unusual approach…\\n[Chance IV involves] a kind of discrete behavioral performance\\nfocused in a highly speciXc manner.\\nHere’s the money quote:\\nWhereas the lucky connections in Chance II might come to anyone\\nwith disposable energy as the happy by-product of any aimless,\\ncircular stirring of the pot, the links of Chance IV can be drawn\\ntogether and fused only by one quixotic rider cantering in on his\\nown homemade hobby horse to intercept the problem at an odd\\nangle.\\nA recap?\\nChance I is completely impersonal; you can’t inYuence it.\\nChance II favors those who have a persistent curiosity about many\\nthings coupled with an energetic willingness to experiment and\\nexplore.\\nChance III favors those who have a suZcient background of sound\\nknowledge plus special abilities in observing, remembering, recalling, and quickly forming signiXcant new associations.\\nChance IV favors those with distinctive, if not eccentric hobbies,\\npersonal lifestyles, and motor behaviors.\\nThis of course leads to a number of challenges for how we live\\nour lives as entrepreneurs and creators in any Xeld:\\n166 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\n• How energetic are we?How inclined towards motion are we?\\nThose of you who read my Xrst age and the entrepreneur\\npost will recognize that this is a variation on the “optimize\\nfor the maximum number of swings of the bat” principle. In\\na highly uncertain world, a bias to action is key to catalyzing\\nsuccess, and luck, and is oaen to be preferred to thinking\\nthings through more throughly.\\n• How curious are we?How determined are we to learn about\\nour chosen Xeld, other Xelds, and the world around us? In my\\npost on hiring great people, I talked about the value I place\\non curiosity — and speciXcally, curiosity over intelligence.\\nThis is why. Curious people are more likely to already have\\nin their heads the building blocks for craaing a solution for\\nany particular problem they come across, versus the more\\nquote-unquote intelligent, but less curious, person who is\\ntrying to get by on logic and pure intellectual eWort.\\n• How Iexible and aggressive are we at synthesizing– at\\nlinking together multiple, disparate, apparently unrelated\\nexperiences on the Yy? I think this is a hard skill to\\nconsciously improve, but I think it is good to start most\\ncreative exercises with the idea that the solution may come\\nfrom any of our past experiences or knowledge, as opposed\\nto out of a textbook or the mouth of an expert. (And, if you\\nare a manager and you have someone who is particularly\\ngood at synthesis, promote her as fast as you possibly can.)\\n• How uniquely are we developing a personal point of view\\n— a personal approach– a personal set of “eccentric hobbies,\\npersonal lifestyles, and motor behaviors” that will uniquely\\nprepare us to create? This, in a nutshell, is why I believe that\\nmost creative people are better oW with more life experience\\nand journeys aXeld into seemingly unrelated areas, as\\nopposed to more formal domain-speciXc education — at\\nleast if they want to create.\\nIn short, I think there is a roadmap to getting luck on our side,\\nand I think this is it.\\nLuck and the entrepreneur: The four kinds of luck 167\\nSerial Entrepreneurs\\nSeveral days ago, Gary Rivlin of the New York Times called me\\nabout a story he was writing about the brilliant Max Levchin of\\nPaypal and Slide, and the general topic of serial entrepreneurs\\nin Silicon Valley. The story came out yesterday; below are the\\nnotes I prepared for my conversation with Gary.\\nIn a nutshell, Gary’s question to me was: what makes serial\\nentrepreneurs tick? Why do people like Max keep going and\\nstart new companies when they could just park it on a beach and\\nsuck down mai tais?\\nFirst, in my experience, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are all over\\nthe map when it comes to personality and motivation. Some\\nare purely mercenary — one hit and they’re out. Others just\\nlove the technology, and the business is a side eWect. Still others\\nare like Chauncey Gardiner in Being There. And some just love\\nstarting and building companies.\\nSecond, there were serial entrepreneurs in the past, but there\\nare certainly more now than ever before. There are many factors that lead to this — here are the big ones:\\n• There are simply more entrepreneurs now — due to the\\namazing surge in venture capital and the culture of startups\\nover the last 10-15 years — so you’d expect more serial\\nentrepreneurs just based on that.\\n• A lot of new companies simply develop faster these days than\\nthey did in the past. Microsoa and Oracle, for example, both\\nput in 10 years of incredibly hard work before going public\\n(both founded in ’76, IPO in ’86), and they only had a few\\nhundred employees each when they went public — and those\\nwere the two biggest soaware successes of their era. Versus\\nthese days, when many companies are founded, built, scaled\\nup, and sold (or, yes, taken public!) in a few years. The\\nprocess can happen so fast that people are freed up much\\nfaster; therefore, upon being freed up they are younger and\\ntend to have more raw energy than people who in the past\\nwould have spent 10 or 20 or 30 years building a single\\ncompany — and by the time they freed up, they maybe\\ndidn’t want to put that level of eWort into something again.\\n• Also because of the faster cycle time, when you start\\ncompany #2 you can assume that it won’t necessarily\\nconsume the next 10-20-30 years of your life… This makes it\\neasier for people to say, OK, hey, it worked once, I’ll try it\\nagain.\\n• The culture of startups in the Valley is clicking on all\\ncylinders — everything from fundraising to hiring to\\nbuilding out a management team to signing up lawyers and\\naccountants and bankers is simply easier than ever before.\\nI’m talking in a macro sense — over the last 10 years, versus\\nprior decades, even considering the early 2000′s bust. So it’s\\njust easier to start the next company that it was the past —\\nthe “pain in the ass” factor is lower.\\n• In terms of exit, there are some IPO’s, but the big thing is\\nthat M&A is a widely accepted and viable exit. Big companies\\nin and related to the Valley have actually become quite good,\\nin general, at acquiring small companies — not perfect, but\\nquite good. They do it frequently, in order to build out their\\nproduct families or grow market share. This of course\\ninspires more companies to be started and tends to compress\\nthe time cycles further.\\nThird, all that said, it is striking how many of the truly revolutionary companies are started, at least in part, by people who\\nSerial Entrepreneurs 169\\nhaven’t done it before. Google (Brin and Page), Yahoo (Yang and\\nFilo), Facebook (Zuckerberg), Apple (Jobs and Wozniak), etc.\\nWhen you see one of those really revolutionary companies and\\nthere’s some young kid with the idea, of course, they oaen are\\nlinked up with one or more seasoned, experienced people —\\nGoogle (Schmidt, Doerr, Moritz), Yahoo (Moritz, Koogle), Facebook (Thiel, Breyer), Apple (Markkula). So even there you see a\\nkind of a serial entrepreneur (or VC or executive) eWect which is\\nanother form of what you’re talking about.\\nFourth, drilling deeper into the motivations of the great serial\\nentrepreneurs I know, the dominant themes are:\\n• Desire to prove oneself — either “I can do it again — it wasn’t\\na Yuke the Xrst time”, or “I was the junior partner last time,\\nnow I’ll be the senior partner”, or “I got Xred from my last\\ncompany, I’ll show those f****** VCs”, or something like that.\\n• Desire to continue working and being productive — “I’m 26\\nor 30 or 34, I have a lot of energy, I have to keep moving, and\\nI’m certainly not going to go to work for some boring big\\ncompany or be another hack VC… obviously I need to start\\nanother company”.\\n• In love with the technology or a new idea — there’s more of\\nthis than cynical people think.\\n• A feeling that we’re in a unique time and place where it’s\\npossible for us to start, build, and be successful with multiple\\ncompanies — it’d be a shame to walk away from the\\nopportunity to continue to be a part of such a magical time\\nand place. This is a big motivator for me, by the way.\\nGrowing up, I would have never dreamed that an industry\\nlike this would exist or that I would get to be a part of it. I\\npinch myself every day.\\n• Money, but not just “I can buy a fancier cashmere car cover”\\nkind of thing (although there is some of that) — just as oaen I\\nthink it’s money as a way to keep score (oaen in the form of\\nsomething like, “I can’t believe Mark Cuban is a billionaire\\nand I’m not; I can do that too”), or money as a way to have an\\nimpact on the world philanthropically — the more you make,\\n170 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nthe more you can give away. That last one is certainly\\nbecoming a bigger and bigger motivator for me.\\nWith any given serial entrepreneur, it’s probably a mix of these.\\nFiLh, a sharply related topic to all of this is that the opportunities are bigger than ever before. It’s not an accident that companies like Google or Facebook or Paypal just get huge, and\\napparently overnight.\\nFor the Xrst time in history, you have a global market of 1+ billion people, all connected over an interactive network where\\nthey’re all a click away from you. That’s amazing.\\nAnd 100 million new people are being added to that count every\\nyear, and that will continue for the next 30 years.\\nA huge and growing market makes all kinds of magical things\\npossible, and I think that’s what we’re seeing now.\\nSerial Entrepreneurs 171\\nThe Back Pages\\nTop 10 science Dction novelists of\\nthe \\'00s ... so far (June 2007)\\nWe are blessed so far this decade with an amazing crop of new\\nscience Xction novelists.\\nWriting in a variety of styles, this crew is arguably more insightful, more interesting, higher intensity, and bolder than many\\n(but not all!) of their predecessors — and in my view revitalizing\\nthe genre at a time when more new technologies that will radically reshape all our lives are incubating and percolating than\\never before.\\nSo, taking nothing away from authors like David Brin who have\\nlong been established and continue to produce top-notch work,\\nhere are my nominations for the top 10 new science Xction novelists of — more or less — the decade, plus one bonus.\\nAnd, they’re not all British.\\nCharles Stross\\nStross, in my opinion, is Xrst among equals — the single best\\nemerging talent with several outstanding novels in various styles\\nunder his belt and hopefully many more to come.\\n“One of us” in the sense that his career includes a stint as —\\nnot kidding — Linux columnist for Computer Shopper magazine,\\nStross is equally adept at both near-future and radically-extrap-\\nolated timeframes, and both hyper-serious and humorous\\nmoods.\\nGlasshouse is Stross’s latest book and perhaps the best introduction to his work. A paranoid journey into a world of intergalactic teleportation and arbitrary physical body reshaping will have\\nyou thinking twice about who you are, and how you know who\\nyou are.\\nSingularity Sky and Iron Sunrise are top-notch post-Singularity space opera featuring perhaps the most inventive alien\\nopponent ever created for science Xction — “the Festival”. You’ll\\nnever look at telephones that drop out of the sky the same way\\nagain.\\nAccelerando is the best envisioning of the Singularity committed to paper so far. This book is really cool, both in the sense\\nof how the kids mean it, and also in tone — the plot, which\\nspans about 100 years, is emotionally cold but amazingly inventive and highly likely to keep you up nights thinking hard about\\nwhere we’re all headed in the long run.\\nThe Atrocity Archives and The Jennifer Morgue, in contrast,\\nare highly entertaining shaggy dog stories about an IT guy\\nnamed Bob who gets draaed into mankind’s Xght against forces\\nof evil from another dimension — James Bond meets Call of\\nCthulhu meets The OZce.\\nFinally, Stross is also an active blogger with, let’s say, strong\\npoints of view.\\nRichard Morgan\\nMorgan writes outstanding, page-turning, highly inventive military- and detective-Yavored hard science Xction set in turbulent\\nworlds where hard men are faced with hard challenges.\\nAltered Carbon is deXnitely the place to start, Morgan’s Xrst and\\nperhaps most inventive novel, Robert Heinlein meets Raymond\\nChandler — and Xrst of a trio.\\n174 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nBroken Angels is a strong followup that tilts more towards military Xction while still occupying the same universe.\\nWoken Furies completes the trilogy with more hard-boiled\\naction featuring a protagonist who has to Xght a younger, and\\nreally mean, version of himself, which he does not enjoy.\\nThirteen is undoubtedly Morgan’s best-written novel so far —\\nthis is an author whose skills are growing rapidly, and this book\\nshows it. Not oZcially released in the US yet (I just read the\\nBritish version, Black Man, renamed for US consumption), Thirteen is a near-future story of genetic engineering gone badly\\nwrong — a future version of all those classic paranoid political\\nthrillers of the 70’s but with a much harder edge. Highly recommended. Also very helpful re advising on things to think about\\nbefore booking your next trip back from Mars.\\nAlastair Reynolds\\nReynolds is the real deal — doctorate in astrophysics and former staW scientist at the European Space Agency — and writes\\nas if Robert Heinlein knew a thousand times more about science\\nand completely lost his ability to write for warm characters.\\nWhile Reynolds’ work is cold and dark — almost sterile — in\\nhuman terms, he operates on a scale and scope seldom seen,\\nand everything he writes is grounded in real advanced theoretical physics. Highly recommended for anyone who likes largescale space opera and big ideas.\\nRevelation Space, Redemption Ark, and Absolution Gap —\\ntogether, Reynolds’ Yagship trilogy — are three of the darkest,\\nlargest-scale, and most scientiXcally complex hard science Xction novels ever written. Highly recommended to anyone who\\nthinks that sounds like a good idea (I did!).\\nCentury Rain is Reynolds’ most approachable novel so far — a\\ntrippy far-future expedition to an apparently inexplicable complete clone of Earth and all its inhabitants from our year 1959.\\nLike Morgan’s work, strong overtones here of Raymond Chandler — in a good way (in a great way).\\nTop 10 science Dction novelists of the \\'00s ... so far (June 2007) 175\\nChasm City has more overshades of Richard Morgan — lots of\\ncombat, science, and intrigue. Are you sure you know who you\\nare?\\nThe Prefect is just out and I haven’t read it yet, but it’s next on\\nthe stack.\\nKen MacLeod\\nMacLeod is incredibly creative — his imagination is second to\\nnone — and he’s a superb writer. Many of his books have political overtones that may or may not interfere with your ability to\\nenjoy them. Sometimes MacLeod seems to think that socialism\\nis going to work a lot better in the future than it did in the past.\\nBut if you can get through that, his novels certainly qualify as\\ndizzyingly inventive and frequently rewarding.\\nThe Star Fraction, The Stone Canal, The Cassini Division,\\nand The Sky Road form the Fall Revolution sequence,\\nMacLeod’s Xrst major body of work. Cyberpunk, political revolution, high-tech combat, love-slave androids, cloning, wormholes, artiXcial intelligence, and nuclear deterrence for hire —\\noh my! Join the Felix Dzerzhinsky Workers’ Defense Collective\\ntoday.\\nThe Execution Channel, MacLeod’s latest, takes a lea turn into\\na paranoid post-9/11 near future featuring war with Iran, Yu\\npandemics, nuclear terrorist attacks, government conspiracies,\\nand the Execution Channel, broadcasting actual footage of murders and executions around the clock. Haven’t read it yet, but\\nsounds like fun.\\nPeter Hamilton\\nHamilton is the clear heir to Heinlein in my view. Large-scale\\nspace opera told through a shiaing and interlinked cast of people from various walks of life, and amazing storytelling — or,\\nas (accurately) blurbed by Richard Morgan, “Yat-out huge\\nwidescreen all-engines-at-full I-dare-you-not-to-believe-it\\nspace opera”.\\nIt’s taken Hamilton a little while to Xnd his talent, but he’s\\n176 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\ndeXnitely found it. His two latest novels are superb: Pandora’s\\nStar and its sequel Judas Unchained. Plain on staying up late,\\nyou’ll roll straight from the Xrst into the second — and they are\\nnot short (in the best way!).\\nJohn Scalzi\\nAnother post-cyberpunk Heinlein heir, Scalzi writes strong,\\nhighly characterized, inventive novels that have been racking\\nup tremendous review aaer tremendous review for the past few\\nyears.\\nStart with Old Man’s War (don’t worry, they put the old dude\\nin a young body, so you don’t need to Xnd out what it’s like\\nto Xght aliens aaer hip replacement surgery). Progress directly\\nto sequel The Ghost Brigades (Sci Fi Essential Books) and\\ntriquel The Last Colony.\\nScalzi is also an active blogger, turns out!\\nNeal Asher\\nThis way lie dragons… literally, and not like you’ve ever met\\nbefore. Asher is an incredidly strong author of science Xction\\nwith a distinctive horror overlay. Not for the squeamish, but\\nhighly inventive.\\nAsher’s primary work is the Polity series — Gridlinked, The\\nLine of Polity, Brass Man, and Polity Agent. The extended\\nstory of an enigmatic agent for the all-powerful artiXcial intelligences who rule the whole of human space, the Polity, these\\nnovels blend Ian Fleming with large-scale military combat,\\nadvanced theoretical xenobiology, nanotechnology gone badly\\nwrong, and war drones with bad attitudes. Most deXnitely entertaining.\\nFollow those up with The Skinner and The Voyage of the Sable\\nKeech, and then the delectable standalone novella Prador\\nMoon. One of the most distinctively imagined “bad bug” alien\\nraces, one of the most creative and lethal new worlds, and a historical scandal of horriXc proportions combine in a whirlwind\\nof violence and battle.\\nTop 10 science Dction novelists of the \\'00s ... so far (June 2007) 177\\nAsher is blogging as well!\\nChris Moriarty\\nGibson meets Heinlein (can you tell I was a Heinlein fan growing up?) in a melange of science Xction themes, most particularly artiXcial intelligence, Xltered through a distinctly female\\npoint of view. A rapidly developing talent worth reading, and\\nwatching for future advances.\\nRead Spin State and then read Spin Control.\\nPeter Watts\\nWatts’ Xah novel, Blindsight, has put him on the map — a new\\ntale of alien contact, as conducted by a team of entitites from a\\nfuture Earth that will send a chill down your spine without even\\ngetting to the alien part.\\nDavid Marusek\\nMy last and Xnal entry of the top 10 is the one I am least certain\\nabout. Marusek is oW the charts in terms of creativity and inventiveness — in his debut novel, Counting Heads, he extrapolates\\nwith incredible verve and detail an Earth circa 2134 that is a\\nnear-utopia. I frankly need to read it again. I think it may be a\\nfailure as a novel, but if so, it’s an amazing failure. Well worth\\nkeeping an eye on at the very least — has to win the award for\\nhighest potential.\\nBonus: Vernor Vinge\\nVinge, a retired San Diego State Univeristy professor of mathematics and computer science, is one of the most important science Xction authors ever — and with Arthur C. Clarke one of the\\nbest forecasters in the world.\\nFirst, if you haven’t had the pleasure, be sure to read True\\nNames, Vinge’s 1981 novella that forecast the modern Internet\\nwith shocking clarity. (Ignore the essays, just read the story.)\\nFans of Gibson and Stephenson will be amazed to see how much\\nmore accurately Vinge called it, and before Neuromancer‘s Xrst\\n178 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\npage cleared Gibson’s manual typewriter. Quoting a reviewer on\\nAmazon:\\nWhen I was starting out as a PhD student in ArtiXcial Intelligence\\nat Carnegie Mellon, it was made known to us Xrst-year students\\nthat an unoZcial but necessary part of our education was to locate\\nand read a copy of an obscure science-Xction novella called True\\nNames. Since you couldn’t Xnd it in bookstores, older grad students\\nand professors would directly mail order sets of ten and set up\\ninformal lending libraries — you would go, for example, to Hans\\nMoravec’s oZce, and sign one out from a little cardboard box over\\nin the corner of his oZce. This was 1983 — the Internet was a toy\\nreserved for American academics, “virtual reality” was not a popular topic, and the term “cyberpunk” had not been coined. One by\\none, we all tracked down copies, and all had the tops of our heads\\nblown oW by Vinge’s incredible book.\\nTrue Names remains to this day one of the four or Xve most seminal science-Xction novels ever written, just in terms of the ideas it\\npresents, and the world it paints. It laid out the ideas that have been\\nsubsequently worked over so successfully by William Gibson and\\nNeal Stephenson. And it’s well written. And it’s fun.\\nSo what? Well, he’s done it again. Vinge’s new novel, Rainbows\\nEnd (yes, the apostrophe is deliberately absent), is the clearest\\nand most plausible extrapolation of modern technology trends\\nforward to the year 2025 that you can imagine.\\nStop reading this blog right now. Go get it. Read it, and then\\ncome back.\\nI’ll wait.\\nIt’s that good.\\nWe’ll see how things turn out, but I would not be the least bit\\nsurprised if we look back from 2025 and say, “I’ll be damned,\\nVinge called it”, just like we look back today on 1981’s True\\nNames and say the same thing.\\nHe better write a sequel.\\nTop 10 science Dction novelists of the \\'00s ... so far (June 2007) 179\\nBubbles on the brain (October\\n2009)\\nIt has become commonplace in Silicon Valley and in the blogosphere to take the position that we are in another bubble —\\na Web 2.0 bubble, or a dot com bubble redux.\\nI don’t think this is true.\\nLet’s examine the theory of a new bubble from a few diWerent\\nangles.\\nFirst, recall that economist Paul Samuelson once quipped,\\n“Economists have successfully predicted nine of the last Xve\\nrecessions.”\\nOne might paraphrase this for our purposes as “Technology\\nindustry experts have successfully predicted nine of the last Xve\\nbubbles”… or perhaps more like Xve of the last one bubbles.\\nThe human psyche seems to have a powerful underlying need\\nto predict doom and gloom.\\nI suspect this need was evolved into us way back when.\\nIf there is a nonzero chance that a giant man-eating saber-tooth\\ntiger is going to come over the nearest hill and chomp you,\\nthen it’s in your evolutionary best interest to predict doom and\\ngloom more frequently than it actually happens.\\nThe cost of hiding from a nonexistent giant man-eating sabertooth tiger is low, but the cost of not hiding from a real giant\\nman-eating saber-tooth tiger is quite high.\\nSo hiding more oaen than there are tigers makes a lot of sense,\\nif you’re a caveman.\\nBut as with other habits ingrained into us by evolution, the habit\\nof predicting doom and gloom when it isn’t in fact right around\\nthe corner might no longer make sense.\\nOn Wall Street, investors who have this habit are known as\\n“perma-bears” and generally are predicting the imminent collapse of the stock market. This habit keeps them from being\\nfully invested. Sure, they’re well protected during the occasional\\ncrash of 1929 or 2000, but by and large they massively underperform their peers who take advantage of the fact that most\\nyears, the economy grows, and the market goes up. They have\\ndisappointing careers and die unhappy and bitter.\\nIn reality it seems very diZcult to predict either a bubble or a\\ncrash.\\nLots of people predicted a stock market crash… in 1995, 1996,\\n1997, 1998, and 1999. They were correct in 2000. But as soon as\\nthe stock market recovered in 2003 and 2004, they were back at\\nit, and there have been similar predictions from noted pundits\\never since — incorrectly.\\nSimilarly, in the technology industry, there were people calling\\na bubble starting in 1995 and continuing through to 2000, with\\na short break for about two years, and then more bubble-calling\\never since.\\nIf you’re going to listen to people who predict bubbles or\\ncrashes, you have to be ready to stay completely out of the market — the stock market, and the technology industry — almost\\nevery year of your life.\\nSecond, historically, bubbles are very, very rare.\\nIt’s signiXcant that in books and papers that talk about bubbles,\\nBubbles on the brain (October 2009) 181\\nthere are simply not that many examples over the past 500\\nyears of capitalism.\\nYou’ve got the South Sea bubble, the Dutch tulip bulb bubble,\\nthe bubble in Japanese stocks in the 1980’s, the dot com bubble,\\nand a few others.\\nThey just don’t happen that oaen, at least in relatively developed economies.\\nAnd they don’t tend to happen more than once in a generation.\\n(Perhaps because many of the people who go through one are so\\ntraumatized that all they can do is sit around and worry about\\nanother one.)\\nInterestingly, modern economic research is in the process of\\ndebunking a number of historical bubbles.\\nIt looks increasingly plausible that had US monetary policy\\nbeen better run in the early 1930’s, our view of what happened\\nin the 1920’s would be far more benign.\\nIt also turns out that the Dutch tulip bubble is largely a myth.\\nSo generally speaking, if one is going to seriously call a bubble,\\none has to be aware that one is calling something that is\\nextremely rare.\\nThird, in the technology industry, lots of startups being funded\\nwith some succeeding and many failing does not equal a bubble.\\nIt equals status quo.\\nThe whole structure of how the technology industry gets\\nfunded — by venture capitalists, angel investors, and Wall Street\\n— is predicated on the baseball model.\\nOut of ten swings at the bat, you get maybe seven strikeouts, two\\nbase hits, and if you are lucky, one home run.\\nThe base hits and the home runs pay for all the strikeouts.\\nIf you’re going to call a bubble on the basis of lots of bad startups\\n182 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\ngetting funded and failing, then you have to conclude that the\\nindustry is in a perpetual bubble, and has been for 40 years.\\nWhich may be fun, but isn’t very useful.\\nLots of people running around starting questionable companies, launching marginal products, pitching third-tier VC’s,\\nthrowing launch parties, shmoozing at conferences, blogging\\nenthusiastically, and otherwise acting bubbly does not a bubble\\nmake.\\nThat’s just life in this business.\\nNote also what you don’t see in the theoretical Web 2.0 bubble\\nof 2007.\\nIPO’s.\\nLots and lots and lots of IPO’s.\\nFor a theoretical bubble, that is just plain odd.\\nFourth, getting more speciXc about Internet businesses — things\\nhave changed a lot since the late 90’s.\\nIt is far cheaper to start an Internet business today than it was in\\nthe late 90’s.\\nThe market for Internet businesses today is much larger than it\\nwas in the late 90’s.\\nAnd business models for Internet businesses today are much\\nmore solid than they were in the late 90’s.\\nThis is a logical consequence of time passing, technology getting more broadly adopted, and the Internet going mainstream\\nas a consumer phenomenon.\\nPeople smarter than me have written about these factors at\\nlength elsewhere, so I won’t dwell on them, unless there is speciXc interest.\\nBut my back of the envelope calculation is that it is about 10x\\ncheaper to start an Internet business today than it was in the\\nBubbles on the brain (October 2009) 183\\nlate 90’s — due to commodity hardware, open source soaware,\\nmodern programming technologies, cheap bandwidth, the rise\\nof third-party ad networks, and other infrastructure factors.\\nAnd the market size for a new Internet business today is about\\n10x bigger than it was in the late 90’s — there are about 10x\\nmore people online (really!), and they are far more used to\\ndoing things on the Internet today than they were in 1999.\\n(Want evidence of that last point? Clothing purchases are now\\nbigger than computer hardware and soaware sales online. I can\\nguarantee you that nobody who was involved in ecommerce in\\nthe mid-90’s ever would have predicted that.)\\nThe Internet is a fully mainstream medium now, people love it,\\npeople are willing to do all kinds of things on it, and it’s getting\\nreally cheap to oWer new services to those people.\\nFiah, and Xnally, there’s the simple fact that the Internet businesses that are succeeding in 2007 are for the most part incredibly valuable, compelling services that lots of people like and that\\nare in general either making a lot of money or will be making a\\nlot of money quite quickly.\\nPeople laughed when Fox bought MySpace for $580 million, but\\nthat’s a business that will generate nearly $300 million in revenue in 2007, and more in 2008.\\nAs an independent asset today, MySpace would probably be valued at between $3 billion and $5 billion today — perhaps higher.\\nCall that the deal of the decade.\\nSimilarly, Facebook is bringing in a lot more revenue than people think.\\nAnd then there’s Google.\\nThese companies aren’t pulling in all that revenue via some\\nkind of Ponzi scheme.\\nThis is money coming from real advertisers and real users for\\nreal services with real value.\\n184 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nWhich makes total sense, amid the enormous mass migration\\nof consumer time and attention away from traditional media\\ntowards online media.\\nThese same factors apply all the way down the foodchain.\\nA high-growth online startup that gets bought for $100 million\\nor $200 million by a large Internet or media company isn’t\\ngetting that kind of acquisition price just for the hell of it, but\\nrather because the acquirer can plug that startup’s service into\\nits broader portfolio of services and make real money with it.\\nThese are big numbers, but remember, there are more than a\\nbillion people online now. That is a very large market — a lot\\nof people, spending a lot of time, buying a lot of things, in\\ntotally new ways at the same time as they are abandoning older\\nservices like newspapers, magazines, television, movie theaters,\\nand print catalogs.\\nSo, my view is that to call a bubble, you have to Xnd evidence of\\nit outside of the mainstream of the kinds of Internet businesses\\nthat are being built, sold, and run in 2007.\\nIn closing, I’d be the last person to say that I never roll my eyes\\nat the next startup that’s doing online wiki-based popularityranked video-podcast mobile social dating widgets for the dog\\nand cat owner market.\\nBut a bubble?\\nI doubt it.\\nBubbles on the brain (October 2009) 185\\nOK, you\\'re right, it IS a bubble\\n(October 2009)\\n[IMPORTANT WARNING: What follows is satire.

For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
        "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
        "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
        "\n",

            "The best way to write a loop in Python largely depends on what you want to achieve with the loop. Here are some common scenarios and the appropriate types of loops to use:\n",
            "\n",
            "### 1. **Using a `for` loop**\n",
            "\n",
            "If you want to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string), a `for` loop is often the best choice. It’s more Pythonic and generally easier to read.\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "# Example: Iterate through a list\n",
            "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
            "for fruit in fruits:\n",
            "    print(fruit)\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. **Using a `while` loop**\n",
            "\n",
            "If you need to repeat an action until a condition changes, a `while` loop is suitable. Just ensure you have a way to break out of the loop to avoid infinite loops.\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "# Example: Using a while loop for a condition\n",

            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3. **Using list comprehensions for concise loops**\n",
            "\n",
            "For simple loops that create a new list, consider using a list comprehension, which is more concise and often more efficient.\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",

            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 4. **Using the `enumerate()` function**\n",
            "\n",
            "When you need access to both the index and the value in a `for` loop, use the `enumerate()` function.\n",

            "- **Avoid modifying the list while iterating**: This can lead to unexpected behavior. Instead, create a copy of the list if needed.\n",
            "- **Consider using functions**: If a loop is complex, consider breaking it out into a function for better readability and reusability.\n",
